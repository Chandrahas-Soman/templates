1 Part I: Political History
1.1 William I
The course of English political, legal and cultural history was changed in 1066, when William,
Duke of Normandy (also called William the Conqueror) successfully invaded the nation and
displaced the Saxon king, Harold II.
In 1066 King Edward, also called St Edward the Confessor, died. His cousin, the Duke of
Normandy, claimed that the childless King had named him heir during a visit to France, and
that the other claimant to the throne, Harold Godwinson, had pledged to support William
when he was shipwrecked in Normandy. The veracity of this tale, however, is doubtful, and
Harold took the crown upon King Edward's death. William, however, invaded England in
September, and defeated (and killed) Harold at the famous Battle of Hastings in October.
1.2 William II
In 1087, King William I died, and divided his lands and riches between his three sons. The
eldest, Robert, became Duke of Normandy; the second, William, became King of England;
the youngest, Henry, received silver. Henry, however, eventually came to possess all of his
father's dominions. William II died without children, so Henry became King. Henry later
invaded Normandy, imprisoned his brother, and took over the Duchy of Normandy.
1.3 Henry I, Stephen and Matilda
Henry, whose sons had predeceased him, took an unprecedented step: naming a woman
as his heir. He declared that his daughter Matilda would be the next Queen. However,
Matilda's claim was disputed by Stephen, a grandson of William I in the female line. After
Henry I died in 1135, Stephen usurped the throne, but he was defeated and imprisoned by
Matilda in 1141. Later, however, Matilda was defeated, and Stephen took the throne.
Matilda, however, was not completely defeated. She escaped from Stephen's army, and her
own son, Henry Plantagenet, led a military expedition against Stephen. Stephen was forced
to agree to name Henry as his heir, and when Stephen died in 1154, Henry took the throne,
commencing the Plantagenet dynasty.

Part I: Political History
1.4 Henry II
With the death of King Stephen, Henry Plantagenet took the throne as King Henry II. He
already had control over the duchy of Normandy; he had also inherited Anjou from his father
Geoffrey. Furthermore, he acquired many territories from his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine.
Henry thus had a vast territory when he came to the throne; as King of England, he took
over Ireland.
Henry II made other remarkable achievements in England. He established courts throughout
England and introduced trial by jury. Furthermore, he reduced the power of ecclesiastical
courts. The Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord High Chancellor, Thomas Ã  Becket, opposed
the King's attempt to take power from the Church. At a confrontation between the two in
1170, Henry II famously said, "Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?" Four of his knights
took him literally, and in December murdered Becket.
Henry, however, did not have good relations with his sons. In 1170, his eldest son Henry was
crowned, and is known as Henry the Young King. In 1173, the Young King and his brothers
revolted against Henry II, planning to dethrone him and leave the Young King as the sole
ruler in England. In 1174, the revolt failed, and all of the brothers surrendered. Later, in
1189, Henry II's third son, Richard, attacked and defeated him. Henry II died days after his
defeat, and Richard, nicknamed "the Lionheart," became King.
1.5 Richard I
Richard the Lionheart is often portrayed as a hero, but he did not do much for England. In
fact, he spent almost all of his time outside the nation, and did not even find it necessary
to learn English. He is most famous for his fighting in the Crusades, a holy war seeking to
assert Christian dominance over Jerusalem.
1.6 John
Richard's successor was his brother, John Allin. Henry II had granted John the lands of
Ireland, so when John came to the throne, the titles Lord of Ireland and King of England
were united. However, though Ireland became a dominion of the Crown, several lands on
the Continent, including most of Normandy, were lost during John's reign.
King John was very unpopular with the nation's magnates, the barons, whom he taxed. A
particularly resented tax was the scutage, a penalty paid by barons who failed to supply the
King with military resources. In 1215, after John had been defeated in France, several barons
rebelled. Later in that year, John compromised and signed the Magna Carta, or Great
Charter. It guaranteed political liberties and provided for a church free from domination by
the monarchy. These liberties and privileges, however, were not extended to the common
man; rather, they were granted to the barons. Nonetheless, the document is immensely
significant in English constitutional history as it is a major indication of a limitation on the
power of the Crown.
4
Henry III
King John, however, broke the provisions of the Charter later, claiming that he agreed to it
under duress. In the next year, when he was retreating from a French invasion, John lost
England's most valuable treasures - the Crown Jewels - in a marsh known as The Wash.
His mental and physical health deteriorated, and he later died from dysentery.
1.7 Henry III
John was succeeded by his son, Henry, who was only nine years old. Henry III, despite a
reign that lasted over half a century, is not a particularly memorable or noteworthy monarch.
Nonetheless, a very significant political development occurred during Henry III's reign. In
1258, one of Henry's opponents, Simon de Montfort, called a Parliament, the forerunner of
the modern institution. It, however, bears little resemblance to the modern body, as it had
little power.
Simon de Montfort, who was married to Henry III's sister, defeated and imprisoned his
brother-in-law in 1264. He was originally supported by Henry's son Edward, but the latter
later returned to his father's side. Edward defeated de Montfort in 1265 at the Battle of
Evesham and restored Henry III. In 1270, the ageing Henry gave up most of power to his
son; two years later, he died, and Edward succeeded to the throne.
1.8 Edward I
Edward I was the monarch who brought the entire British Isles under English domination.
In order to raise money in the war against the rebellious Wales, Edward instituted a tax on
Jewish moneylenders. The tax, however, was too high for the moneylenders, who eventually
became too poor to pay. Edward accused them of disloyalty and abolished the right of Jews
to lend money. He also ordered that all Jews wear a yellow star on their clothing; that idea
was later adopted by Adolf Hitler in Germany. Edward also executed hundreds of Jews, and
in 1290 banished all of them from England.
In 1291, the Scottish nobility agreed to submit to Edward. When Queen Margaret I died, the
nobles allowed Edward to choose between the rival claimants to the throne. Edward installed
the weak John Balliol as monarch, and easily dominated Scotland. The Scots, however,
rebelled. Edward I executed the chief dissenter, William Wallace, further antagonising
Scotland.
1.9 Edward II
When Edward I died in 1307, his son Edward became King. Edward II abandoned his
father's ambitions to conquer Scotland. Furthermore, he recalled several men his father had
banished. The barons, however, rebelled against Edward. In 1312, Edward agreed to hand
over power to a committee of barons known as "ordainers." These ordainers removed the
power of representatives of commoners to advise the monarch on new laws, and concentrated
all power in the nobility. Meanwhile, Robert the Bruce was slowly reconquering Scotland.
5
Part I: Political History
In 1314, Robert's forces defeated England's in battle, and Robert gained control over most
of Scotland.
In 1321, the ordainers banished a baron allied with the King, Hugh le Despencer, along with
his son. In 1322, Edward reacted by recalling them and attacking the barons. He executed
the leader of the ordainers, the Earl of Lancaster, and permitted the Despencers to rule
England. The Despencers declared that all statutes created by the ordainers were invalid,
and that thereafter, no law would be valid unless it had received the assent of the Commons,
representatives of the commoners of England. However, the Despencers became corrupt,
causing them to be very unpopular, even with Edward's own wife, Isabella. In 1325, Isabella
went to France, and in 1326, she returned, allied with Roger Mortimer, one of the barons
Edward had defeated. The two killed the Despencers and forced Edward to resign his crown
to his son, also named Edward. Edward II was imprisoned and later killed.
1.10 Edward III
Since Edward III was a child, Isabella and Roger Mortimer ruled England in his stead. When
Edward III became eighteen, however, he had Mortimer executed and banished his mother
from court. In 1328, when Charles IV, Isabella's father and King of France, died, Edward
claimed France, suggesting that the kingdom should pass to him through his mother. His
claim was opposed by Philip VI, who claimed that the throne could only pass in the male
line. Edward declared war on Philip, setting off the Hundred Years' War. The British claim
to the French throne was not abandoned until the nineteenth century.
1.11 Richard II
Richard II succeeded his grandfather, Edward III, in 1377. Richard II was only about ten
years old when coming to the throne. Even as an adult, Richard II was a rather weak king.
In 1399, he was deposed by his cousin, Henry of Bolingbroke, and probably murdered the
next year.
1.12 Henry IV
Henry of Bolingbroke deposed his weak cousin, Richard II, in 1399. Henry IV's reign was
marked by widespread rebellion. These were put down thanks to the great military skill of
the Henry IV's son, the future King Henry V. Henry IV died in 1413 while plagued by a
severe skin disease (possibly leprosy).
1.13 Henry V
Henry V's reign was markedly different from his father's in that it involved little domestic
turmoil. Overseas, Henry V's armies won several important victories in France. In 1415, the
6
Henry V
English defeated the French King Charles VI decisively at the Battle of Agincourt. About
100 English soldiers were killed, along with about 5000 Frenchmen.
For the next two years, Henry V conducted delicate diplomacy to improve England's chances
of conquering France. He negotiated with the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, who agreed
to end the German alliance with France. In 1417, the war was renewed; by 1419, English
troops were about to take Paris. The parties agreed to a treaty whereby Henry V was named
heir of France. Henry V, however, died before he could succeed to the French throne, which
therefore remained in the hands of the Frenchmen.

1.14 Henry VI and Edward IV
Figure 1 Figure 3-1: Edward IV (left) and the future Edward V (centre)
Henry VI succeeded to the throne while still an infant. His uncles, the Dukes of Bedford
and Gloucester, both functioned as Regents. During his reign, many French territories won
during the Hundred Years War were lost.
Henry VI's reign was interrupted by Edward IV's due to the War of the Roses. Henry VI
was a member of the House of Lancaster, while Edward IV was from the House of York.
The former House descended from Henry of Bolingbroke, the fourth son of King Edward III;
the latter House descended from Edmund of Langley, Edward III's fifth son.
8
Edward V and Richard III
In 1461, the Lancastrians lost to the Yorkists at the Battle of Towton. The Yorkist claimant,
Edward IV, ascended to the throne, with the support of the powerful nobleman Richard
Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, known by the nickname Warwick the Kingmaker. In 1464,
Lancastrian revolts were put down. In 1469, however, Warwick the Kingmaker switched his
allegiance, and in 1470, Henry VI was restored to the throne. The exiled Edward, however,
soon returned and defeated Henry's forces. At the Battle of Tewkesbury, the remaining
Lancastrians were defeated; Henry VI was also murdered.
1.15 Edward V and Richard III
Edward IV was succeeded by his twelve year-old son in 1483. Edward IV's brother, Richard,
was made guardian of Edward V and his brother, also named Richard. The young King's
uncle usurped the throne and had Parliament declare the two brothers illegitimate. The two
princes were then imprisoned in the Tower of London, where they might have been killed
(their fate, however, is not certain).
In 1485, Richard III faced Henry Tudor, the Lancastrian claimant, at the Battle of Bosworth
Field, during which Richard became the last English monarch to be killed during battle.
Henry came to power as Henry VII, establishing the Tudor Dynasty.
ms:Perlembagaan dan Kerajaan United Kingdom: Dewan Lancaster dan York2
1.16 Henry VII
Henry VII was one of the most successful monarchs in British history. He was the Lancastrian
claimant to the throne and lived in France so as to remain safe from the designs of the
Yorkist Kings. At the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, he defeated and killed the Yorkist
Richard III. His claim was weak due to questions relating to the legitimacy of certain births,
but he was nonetheless awarded the throne.
Henry reformed the nation's taxation system and refilled the nation's treasury, which had
been bankrupted by the fiscal irresponsibility of his predecessors. He also made peace with
France so that the resources of the nation would not be spent trying to regain territories
won during the Hundred Years' War. Henry also created marital alliances with Spain and
Scotland. Henry's son, Arthur, married Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Ferdinand II of
Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. Furthermore, Henry's daughter Margaret married James
IV, King of Scots.
When Henry's son Arthur died, he wished to protect the Anglo-Spanish alliance. Therefore,
he obtained a dispensation from Pope Julius II allowing Henry's son, also named Henry, to
marry Catherine. (Papal permission was necessary since Henry was marrying his brother's
widow.) Upon Henry VII's death, Henry took the throne as Henry VIII.

Part I: Political History
1.17 Henry VIII
King Henry VIII is often remembered for his multiple marriages. In his quest to obtain
a male heir to the throne, Henry married six different times. His first marriage, as noted
above, was to his brother's widow, Catherine of Aragon. That marriage occurred in 1509
and was scarred by several tragedies involving their children. The couple's first child was
stillborn, their second lived for just 52 days, the third pregnancy ended as a miscarriage
and the product of the fourth pregnancy died soon after birth. In 1516, the couple had a
daughter, named Mary, followed by another miscarriage. Henry was growing impatient with
his wife and eagerly sought a male heir.
Henry sought to annul his marriage to Catherine. Ecclesiastic law permitted a man to marry
his brother's widow only if the previous marriage had not been consummated. Catherine
had informed the Pope that her marriage was non-consummate, so the Pope agreed to grant
a dispensation allowing her to marry Henry. Now, however, Henry alleged that Catherine
had lied, thereby rendering her marriage to him invalid. In 1533, an Act of Parliament
annulled his marriage to Catherine, enabling him to marry Anne Boleyn. It was felt by
many, however, that the Church, and not Parliament, could govern marriages. Henry had
asked Pope Clement VII to issue a divorce several times. Under pressure from Catherine's
nephew, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, the Pope refused. Parliament therefore passed an
Act denying appeals to Rome from certain decisions of English Archbishops. The Archbishop
of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, annulled Henry's marriage to Catherine. In response, the
Pope excommunicated Henry. Soon, the Church of England separated from the Roman
Catholic Church. In 1534, all appeals to Rome from the decisions of the English clergy were
stopped. An Act of Parliament passed in 1536 confirmed the King's position as Supreme
Head of the Church of England, thereby ending any ceremonial influence that the Pope still
had.
Anne Boleyn, meanwhile, was Henry's Queen, and the only surviving child from the marriage
to Catherine, Mary, was declared illegitimate. Anne's first child, Elizabeth, was born in 1533.
The next three pregnancies, however, all resulted in stillbirth or miscarriage. A dissatisfied
Henry accused Anne of using witchcraft to entice him to marry her and to have five men
enter into adulterous affairs with her. Furthermore, Anne was accused of treason because
she had supposedly committed adultery while she was Queen. Anne's marriage to Henry
VIII was annulled and she was executed at the Tower of London in 1536.
Within two weeks of Anne's death, Henry married Jane Seymour. In 1537, Jane produced the
male heir that Henry had long desired. The boy was named Edward and would later succeed
Henry to the throne. Meanwhile, his half-sister Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. Shortly
after the birth of the child, Jane died. Jane was followed as Queen by Anne of Cleeves,
whom Henry married in 1540. Anne was the daughter of John III, Duke of Cleeves. Henry
did not actually see Anne until shortly before their marriage; the relationship was contracted
to establish an alliance between Henry and the Duke of Cleeves, a major Protestant leader.
After Anne married him, Henry found her physically displeasing and unattractive. Shortly
thereafter, the marriage was annulled on the grounds that Anne had previously been engaged
to the Duke of Lorraine. After her divorce, Anne was treated well. She was given the title
of Princess and allowed to live in Hever Castle, the former home of Anne Boleyn's family.
10
Edward VI and Lady Jane Grey
Henry VIII's next marriage was to Catherine Howard, an Englishwoman of noble birth. In
1542, she was charged and convicted of high treason after having admitted to being engaged
in an adulterous affair. In 1543, Henry contracted his final marriage, wedding Catherine
Parr. The marriage lasted for the remainder of Henry's life, which ended in 1547.
1.18 Edward VI and Lady Jane Grey
When Edward VI, son of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour, came to the throne, he was just ten
years old. His uncle, Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset served as Lord Protector while
the King was a minor. Several nobles attempted to take over Somerset's role. John Dudley,
1st Earl of Warwick was successful; he was later created Duke of Northumberland.
Edward VI was the first Protestant King of England. His father had broken away from the
Roman Catholic Church but had not yet embraced Protestantism. Edward, however, was
brought up Protestant. He sought to exclude his Catholic half-sister Mary from the line of
succession. As he was dying at the age of fifteen, he made a document barring his half-sisters
Mary and Elizabeth from the throne. He named the Lady Jane Grey, daughter-in-law of the
Duke of Northumberland, his successor. Her claim to the throne was through her mother,
who was a granddaughter of King Henry VII. Jane was proclaimed Queen upon Edward's
death in 1553, but she served for only nine days before being deposed by Mary. Mary
enjoyed far more popular support; the public also sympathised with the way her mother,
Catherine of Aragon, had been treated. Jane was soon executed; she was seventeen years
old at the time.
1.19 Mary I
Mary was deeply opposed to her father's break from the Church in Rome. She sought to
reverse reforms instituted by her Protestant half-brother. Mary even resorted to violence in
her attempt to restore Catholicism, earning her the nickname Bloody Mary. She executed
several Protestants, including the former Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer, on
charges of heresy.
In 1554, Mary married the Catholic King of Spain, Philip II. The marriage was unpopular
in England, even with Catholic subjects. The couple were unable to produce a child before
Mary's death from cancer in 1558.
1.20 Elizabeth I
Mary's successor, her half-sister Elizabeth, was one of the most successful and popular
British monarchs. The Elizabethan era was associated with cultural development and the
expansion of English territory through colonialism.
After coming to power, Elizabeth quickly reversed many of Mary's policies. Elizabeth
reinstated the Church of England and had Parliament pass the Act of Supremacy, which
confirmed the Sovereign's position as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. The
11
Part I: Political History
Act also forced public and clerical officers to take the Oath of Supremacy recognising the
Sovereign's position. Elizabeth, however, did practice limited toleration towards Catholics.
After Pope Pius V excommunicated Elizabeth in 1570, Elizabeth ended her policy of religious
toleration. One of Elizabeth's chief Catholic enemies was the Queen of Scotland, Mary. Since
Elizabeth neither married nor bore any children, her cousin Mary was a possible heir to the
English throne. Another possible heir was Lady Jane Grey's sister, Catherine. However,
when Lady Catherine Grey died in 1568, Elizabeth was forced to consider that Catholic
Mary was the most likely heir. Mary, however, had earlier been deposed by Scottish nobles,
putting her infant son James on the throne. Mary had fled to England, hoping Elizabeth
would aid her efforts to regain the Scottish throne, but Elizabeth reconsidered after learning
of the "Ridolfi Plot", a scheme to assassinate Elizabeth and put the Roman Catholic Mary
on the English throne. In 1572, Parliament passed a bill to exclude Mary from the line of
succession, but Elizabeth refused to grant Royal Assent to it. Eventually, however, Mary
proved to be too much of a liability due to her constant involvement in plots to murder
Elizabeth. In 1587, she was executed after having been convicted of being involved in one
such plot.
Following Mary's execution, Philip II (widower of Mary I of England) sent a fleet of Spanish
ships known as the Armada to invade England. England had supported a Protestant rebellion
in the Netherlands and was seen as a threat to Catholicism. Furthermore, England had
interfered with Spanish shipping and trade. Using Mary's execution as an excuse, Philip II
obtained the Pope's authority to depose Elizabeth. In 1588, the Spanish Armada set sail for
England. Harmed by bad weather, the Armada was defeated by Elizabeth's naval leaders,
including Sir Francis Drake and the Lord Howard of Effingham.
Towards the end of her life, Elizabeth still failed to name an heir. When she died, she was
ironically succeeded by the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, James. James was already James
VI, King of Scots; he became James I of England in 1603 and established the rule of the
Stuart dynasty.
12
James I
1.21 James I
Figure 2 James I of England
With the death of Elizabeth in 1603, the Crowns of England and Scotland united under
James I. In 1567, when he was just a year old, James' mother Mary was forced to abdicate,
and James became King James VI. Despite his mother's Catholicism, James was brought
up as a Protestant.
One of James' first acts as King was to conclude English involvment in the Eighty Years'
War, also called the Dutch Revolt. Elizabeth had supported the Protestant Dutch rebels,
13
Part I: Political History
providing one cause for Philip II's attack. In 1604, James signed the Treaty of London,
thereby making peace with Spain.
James had significant difficulty with the English Parliamentary structure. As King of Scots,
he had not been accustomed to criticism from the Parliament. James firmly believed in the
Divine Right of Kingsâthe right of Kings to rule that supposedly came from Godâso he
did not easily react to critics in Parliament. Under English law, however, it was impossible
for the King to levy taxes without Parliament's consent, so he had to tolerate Parliament
for some time.
King James died in 1625 and was succeeded by his son Charles.
1.22 Charles I
King Charles ruled at a time when Europe was moving toward domination by absolute
monarchs. The French ruler, Louis XIV, epitomised this absolutism. Charles, sharing his
father's belief in the Divine Right of Kings, also moved toward absolutist policies.
Charles conflicted with Parliament over the issue of the Huguenots, French Protestants.
Louis XIV had begun a persecution of the Huguenots; Charles sent an expedition to La
Rochelle to provide aid to the Protestant residents. The effort, however, was disastrous,
prompting Parliament to further criticise him. In 1628, the House of Commons issued the
Petition of Right, which demanded that Charles cease his use of arbitrary power. Charles
had persecuted individuals using the Court of the Star Chamber, a secret court that could
impose any penalty, even torture, except for death. Charles had also imprisoned individuals
without a trial and denied them the right to the writ of habeas corpus. The Petition of
Right, however, was not successful; in 1629, Charles dissolved Parliament. He ruled alone
for the next eleven years, which is sometimes referred to as the eleven years of tyranny or
personal rule. Since Parliamentary approval was required to impose taxes, Charles had grave
difficulty in keeping the government functional. Charles imposed several taxes himself; these
were widely seen as unlawful.
During these eleven years, Charles began instituting religious reforms in Scotland, moving it
towards the English model. He attempted to impose the Anglican Prayer Book on Scottish
churches, leading to riots and violence. In 1638, the General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland abolished the office of bishop and established Presbyterianism (an ecclesiastic
system without clerical officers such as bishops and archbishops). Charles sent his armies
to Scotland, but was quickly forced to end the conflict, known as the First Bishops' War,
because of a lack of funding. Charles granted Scotland certain parliamentary and ecclesiastic
freedoms in 1639.
In 1640, Charles finally called a Parliament to authorise additional taxation. Since the
Parliament was dissolved within weeks of its summoning, it was known as the Short
Parliament. Charles then sent a new military expedition to Scotland to fight the Second
Bishops' War. Again, the Royal forces were defeated. Charles then summoned Parliament
again, this Parliament becoming known as the Long Parliament, in order to raise funds for
making reparations to the Scots.
14
Oliver and Richard Cromwell
Tension between Charles and Parliament increased dramatically. Charles agreed to abolish
the hated Star Chamber, but he refused to give up control of the army. In 1641, Charles
entered the House of Commons with armed guards in order to arrest his Parliamentary
enemies. They had already fled, however, and Parliament took the breach of their premises
very seriously. (Since Charles, no English monarch has sought to set foot in the House of
Commons.)
The unsafe monarch moved the Royal court to Oxford. Royal forces controlled north and
west England, while Parliament controlled south and east England. A Civil War broke out,
but was indecisive until 1644, when Parliamentary forces clearly gained the upper hand.
In 1646, Charles was forced to escape to Scotland, but the Scottish army delivered him to
Parliament in 1647. Charles was then imprisoned. Charles negotiated with the Scottish army,
declaring that if it restored him to power, he would implement the Scottish Presbyterian
ecclesiastic model in England. In 1648, the Scots invaded England, but were defeated.
The House of Commons began to pass laws without the consent of either the Sovereign or
the House of Lords, but many MPs still wished to come to terms with the king. Members
of the army, however, felt that Charles had gone too far by sideing with the Scots against
England and were determined to have him brought to trial. In December 1648 an army
regiment, Colonel Pride's, used force to bar entry into the House of Commons, only allowing
MPs who would support the army to remain. These MPs, the Rump Parliament, established
a commission of 135 to try Charles for treason. Charles, an ardent believer in the Divine
Right of Kings, refused to accept the jurisdiction of any court over him. Therefore, he was
by default considered guilty of high treason and was executed on January 30, 1649.
1.23 Oliver and Richard Cromwell
At first, Oliver Cromwell ruled along with the republican Parliament, the state being known
as the Commonwealth of England. After Charles' execution, however, Parliament became
disunited. In 1653, he suspended Parliament, and as Charles had done earlier, began several
years of rule as a dictator. Later, Parliament was recalled, and in 1657 offered to make
Cromwell the King. Since he faced opposition from his own senior military officers, Cromwell
declined. Instead, he was made a Lord Protector, even being installed on the former King's
throne. He was a King in all but name.
Cromwell died in 1658 and was succeeded by his son Richard, an extremely poor politician.
Richard Cromwell was not interested in his position and abdicated quickly. The Protectorate
was ended and the Commonwealth restored. Anarchy was the result. Quickly, Parliament
chose to reestablish the monarchy by inviting Charles I's son to take the throne as Charles
II.
1.24 Charles II
During the rule of Oliver Cromwell, Charles II remained King in Scotland. After an
unsuccessful challenge to Cromwell's rule, Charles escaped to Europe. In 1660, when
England was in anarchy, Charles issued the Declaration of Breda, outlining his conditions
15
Part I: Political History
for returning to the Throne. The Long Parliament, which had been convened in 1640, finally
dissolved itself. A new Parliament, called the Convention Parliament, was elected; it was
far more favourable to the Royalty than the Long Parliament. In May 1660, the Convention
Parliament that Charles had been the lawful King of England since the death of his father
in 1649. Charles soon arrived in London and was restored to actual power. Charles granted
a general pardon to most of Cromwell's supporters. Those who had directly participated in
his father's execution, however, were either executed or imprisoned for life. Cromwell himself
suffered a posthumous execution: his body was exhumed, hung, drawn and quartered, his
head cut off and displayed from a pole and the remainder of his body thrown into a common
pit. The posthumous execution took place on the anniversary of Charles I's death.
Charles also dissolved the Convention Parliament. The next Parliament, called the Cavalier
Parliament was soon elected. The Cavalier Parliament lasted for seventeen years without
an election before being dissolved. During its long tenure, the Cavalier Parliament enacted
several important laws, including many that suppressed religious dissent. The Act of
Uniformity required the use of the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer in all
Church services. The Conventicle Act prohibited religious assemblies of more than five
members except under the Church of England. The Five Mile Act banned non-members of
the Church of England from living in towns with a Royal Charter, instead forcing them into
the country. In 1672, Charles mitigated these laws with the Royal Declaration of Indulgence,
which provided for religious toleration. Parliament, however, suspected him of Catholicism
and forced him to withdraw the Declaration. In 1673, Parliament passed the Test Act, which
required civil servants to swear an oath against Catholicism.
Parliament's suspicions did turn out to be accurate. As Charles II lay dying in 1685, he
converted to Catholicism. Charles did not have a single legitimate child, though he did
have, while living in Europe, several illegitimate ones (over 300 by some estimates). He was
succeeded, therefore, by his younger brother James, an open Catholic.
1.25 James II
James II (James VII in Scotland) was an extremely controversial monarch due to his
Catholicism. Soon after he took power, a Protestant illegitimate son of Charles II, James
Scott, Duke of Monmouth, proclaimed himself King. James II defeated him within a few
days and had him executed.
James made himself highly unpopular by appointing Catholic officials, especially in Ireland.
Later, he established a standing army in peacetime, alarming many Protestants. Rebellion,
however, did not occur because people trusted James' daughter Mary, a Protestant. In
1688, however, James produced a son, who was brought up Catholic. Since Mary's place in
the line of succession was lowered, and a Catholic Dynasty in England seemed ineveitable,
the "Immortal Seven"âthe Duke of Devonshire, the Earl of Danby, the Earl of Shrewsbury,
the Viscount Lumley, the Bishop of London, Edward Russell and Henry Sidneyâconspired
to replace James and his son with Mary and her Dutch husband William of Orange. In
1688, William and Mary invaded England and James fled the country. The revolution was
hailed as the Glorious Revolution or the Bloodless Revolution. Though the latter term was
innacurate, the revolution was not as violent as the War of the Roses or the English Civil
War.
16
William and Mary
1.26 William and Mary
Parliament wished then to make Mary the sole Queen. She, however, refused and demanded
that she be made co-Sovereign with her husband. In 1689, the Parliament of England
declared in the English Bill of Rights, one of the most significant constitutional documents
in British history, that James' flight constituted an abdication of the throne and that the
throne should go jointly to William (William III) and Mary (Mary II). The Bill of Rights
also required that the Sovereign cannot deny certain rights, such as freedom of speech in
Parliament, freedom from taxation without Parliament's consent and freedom from cruel
and unusual punishment. In Scotland, the Estates General passed a similar Act, called the
Claim of Right, which also made William and Mary joint rulers. In Ireland, power had to
be won in battle. In 1690, the English won the Battle of the Boyne, thereby establishing
William and Mary's rule over the entire British Isles.
For the early part of the reign, Mary administered the Government while William controlled
the military. Unpopularly, William appointed people from his native Holland as officers
in the English army and Royal Navy. Furthermore, he used English military resources to
protect the Netherlands. In 1694, after the death of Queen Mary from smallpox, William
continued to rule as the sole Sovereign.
Since William and Mary did not have children, William's heir was Anne, who had seventeen
pregnancies, most of which ended in stillbirth. In 1700, Anne's last surviving child, William,
died at the age of eleven. Parliament was faced with a succession crisis, because after Anne,
many in the line of succession were Catholic. Therefore, in 1701, the Act of Settlement was
passed, allowing Sophia, Electress and Duchess Dowager of Hanover (a German state), and
her Protestant heirs, to succeed if Anne had no further children. Sophia's claim stemmed
from her great-grandfather, James I. Several lines that were more senior to Sophia's were
bypassed under the act. Some of these had questionable legitimacy, while others were
Catholic. The Act of Settlement also banned non-Protestants and those who married
Catholics from the throne.
In 1702, William died, and his sister-in-law Anne became Queen.
1.27 Anne
Even following the passage of the Act of Settlement, Protestant succession to the throne
was insecure in Scotland. In 1703, the Scottish Parliament, the Estates, passed a bill that
required that, if Anne died without children, the Estates could appoint any Protestant
descendant of Scottish monarchs as the King. The individual appointed could not be the
same person who would, under the Act of Settlement, succeed to the English crown unless
several economic conditions were met. The Queen's Commissioner refused Royal Assent
on her behalf. The Scottish Estates then threatened to withdraw Scottish troops from the
Queen's armies, which were then engaged in the War of the Spanish Succession in Europe
and Queen Anne's War in North America. The Estates also threatened to refuse to levy
taxes, so Anne relented and agreed to grant Royal Assent to the bill, which became the Act
of Security.
17
Part I: Political History
The English Parliament feared the separation of the Crowns which had been united since
the death of Elizabeth I. They therefore attempted to coerce Scotland, passing the Alien
Act in 1705. The Alien Act provided for cutting off trade between England and Scotland.
Scotland was already suffering from the failure of the DariÃ©n Scheme, a disastrous and
expensive attempt to establish Scottish colonies in America. Scotland quickly began to
negotiate union with England. In 1707, the Act of Union was passed, despite mass protest in
Scotland, by Parliament and the Scottish Estates. The Act combined England and Scotland
into one Kingdom of Great Britain, terminated the Parliament and Estates, and replaced
them with one Parliament of Great Britain. Scotland was entitled to elect a certain number
of members of the House of Commons. Furthermore, it was permitted to send sixteen of its
peers to sit along with all English peers in the House of Lords. The Act guaranteed Scotland
the right to retain its distinct legal system. The Church of Scotland was also guaranteed
independence from political interference. Ireland remained a separate country, though still
governed by the British Sovereign.
Anne is often remembered as the last British monarch to deny Royal Assent to a bill, which
she did in 1707 to a militia bill. Due to her poor health, made worse by her failed pregnancies,
her government was run through her ministers. She died in 1714, to be succeeded by George,
Elector of Hanover, whose mother Sophia had died a few weeks earlier.
18
George I
1.28 George I
Figure 3 King George I
George, Duke and Elector of Hanover became King George I in 1714. His claim was opposed
by the Jacobites, supporters of the deposed King James II. Since James II had died, his
claim was taken over by his son, James Francis Edward Stewart, the "Old Pretender." In
1715, there was a Jacobite rebellion, but an ill James could not lead it. By the time he
recovered, it was too late, and the rebellion was supressed.
King George was not deeply involved in British politics; instead, he concentrated on matters
in his home, Germany. The King could not even speak English, earning the ridicule of
19
Part I: Political History
many of his subjects. George, furthermore, spent much time in his native land of Hanover.
Meanwhile, a ministerial system developed in Great Britain. George appointed Sir Robert
Walpole as First Lord of the Treasury. Walpole was George's most powerful minister, but he
was not termed "Prime Minister"; that term came into use in later years. Walpole's tenure
began in 1721; other ministers held office at his, rather than the King's, pleasure. George's
lack of involvement in politics contributed greatly to the development of the modern British
political system.
George died in 1727 from a stroke while in Germany. He was succeeded by his son, who
ruled as George II.
1.29 George II
George II was naturalised as a British citizen in 1705; his reign began in 1727. Like his
father, George transferred political power to Sir Robert Walpole, who served until 1742.
Walpole was succeeded by Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington, who served until 1743,
and then by Henry Pelham, who served until his death in 1754. During Pelham's service,
the nation experienced a second Jacobite Rebellion, which was almost successful in putting
Bonnie Prince Charlieâson of the Old Pretender, himself called the Young Pretenderâon
the throne. The rebellion began in 1745 and was ended in 1746 when the King's forces
defeated the Jacobites at the Battle of Culloden, the last battle ever to be fought on British
soil.
Before George II's death in 1760, he was served by two other Prime Ministers: Henry
Pelham's elder brother the Duke of Newcastle, and the Duke of Devonshire. George II's
eldest son, Frederick, had predeceased him, so George was succeeded by his grandson, also
named George.
1.30 George III
George III attempted to reverse the trend that his Hanoverian predecessors had set by
reducing the influence of the Prime Minister. He appointed a variety of different people
as his Prime Minister, on the basis of favouratism rather than ability. The Whig Party of
Robert Walpole declared George an autocrat and compared him to Charles I.
George III's reign is notable for many important international events. In 1763, Great Britain
defeated France in the Seven Years' War, a global war that also involved Spain, Portugal
and the Netherlands and was fought in Europe, America and India. As a result of the Treaty
of Paris, New France (the French territory in North America, including Quebec and land
east of the Mississippi) was ceded to Britain, as was Spanish Florida. Spain, however, took
New Orleans and Louisiana, the vast French territory on the west of the Mississippi. Great
Britain came to be recognised as the world's pre-eminent colonial power, displacing France.
The nation, however, was left deeply in debt. To overcome it, British colonies in America
were taxed, much to their distaste. Eventually, Britain lost its American colonies during the
American War of Independence, which lasted from 1776 to 1783. Elsewhere, however, the
British Empire continued to expand. In India, the British East India Company took control
20
George IV
of many small nation-states nominally headed by their own princes. The island of Australia
was also occupied, and Canada's population increased with the number of British Loyalists
who left the newly formed United States of America.
In 1801, Parliament passed the Act of Union, uniting Great Britain and Ireland into the
United Kingdom. Ireland was allowed to elect 100 Members of Parliament to the House of
Commons and 22 representative peers to the House of Lords. The Act originally provided
for the removal of restrictions from Roman Catholics, but George III refused to agree to the
proposal, arguing that doing so would violate his oath to maintain Protestantism.
George was the last British monarch to claim the Kingdom of France. He was persuaded to
abandon the meaningless claim dating to the Plantagenet days in 1801 by the French ruler
Napoleon.
In 1811, George III, who had previously suffered bouts of madness, went permanantly insane.
His son George ruled the country as Prince Regent, and became George IV when the King
died in 1820.
1.31 George IV
George IV is often remembered as an unwise and extravagant monarch. During his Regency,
London was redesigned, and funding for the arts was increased. As King, George was unable
to govern effectively; he was overweight, possibly addicted to a form of opium and showing
signs of his father's mental disease. While he ruled, George's ministers were once again able
to regain the power that they had lost during his father's reign.
George opposed several popular social reforms. As his father, he refused to lift several
restrictions on Roman Catholics. Upon his death in 1830, his younger brother began to
reign as William IV.
1.32 William IV
Early in William's reign, British politics was reformed by the Reform Act of 1832. At the
time, the House of Commons was a disorganised and undemocratic body, unlike the modern
House. The nation included several rotten boroughs, which historically had the right to elect
members of Parliament, but actually had very few residents. The rotten borough of Old
Sarum, for instance, had seven voters, but could elect two MPs. An even more extreme
example is of Dunwich, which could also elect two MPs despite having no residents, the
entire borough having been eroded away into the North Sea. Other boroughs were called
pocket boroughs because they were "in the pocket" of a wealthy landowner, whose son was
normally elected to the seat. At the same time, entire cities such as Westminster (with
about 20,000 voters) still had just two MPs.
The House of Commons agreed to the Reform Bill, but it was rejected by the House of Lords,
whose members controlled several pocket boroughs. The Tory Party, furthermore, opposed
the bill actively. William IV agreed with his Prime Minister, the Earl Grey, to flood the
House of Lords with pro-reform members by creating fifty new peerages; when the time
21
Part I: Political History
came, he backed down. The Earl Grey and his Whig Party government then resigned, but
returned to power when William finally agreed to co-operate. The Reform Act of 1832 gave
urban areas increased political power, but allowed aristocrats to retain effective control of
the rural areas. Over fifty rotten boroughs were abolished, while the representation of some
other boroughs was reduced from two MPs to one. Though members of the middle class
were granted the right to vote, the Reform Act did not do much to expand the electorate,
which amounted after passage to just three percent of the population.
In 1834, William became the last British monarch to appoint a Prime Minister who did
not have the confidence of Parliament. He replaced the Whig Prime Minister, the Viscount
Melbourne, with a Tory, Sir Robert Peel. Peel, however, had a minority in the House of
Commons, so he resigned in 1835, and Melbourne returned to power.
In 1837, William died and was succeeded on the British throne by his niece Victoria, who
was just eighteen years old at the time. The union of the Crowns of Britain and Hanover
was then dissolved, since Salic Law, which applied in Hanover, only allowed males to rule.
Therefore, Hanover passed to William's brother Ernest.
22
Victoria
1.33 Victoria
Figure 4 Queen Victoria
A few years after taking power, Victoria married a German Prince, Albert of Saxe-CoburgGotha, who was given the title of Prince Consort. Albert originally wished to actively govern
the United Kingdom, but he acquiesced to his wife's requests to the contrary. The extremely
happy marriage ended with Albert's death in 1861, following which Victoria entered a period
of semi-mourning that would last for the rest of her reign. She was often called the Widow
of Windsor, after Windsor Castle, a Royal home.
23
Part I: Political History
In 1867, Parliament passed another Reform Act. Like its predecessor, the Reform Act
of 1832, true electoral reform was not achieved; the property qualifications limited the
electorate to about eight percent of the population. Therafter, power was held by two
Prime MinistersâBenjamin Disraeli (a Tory and a favourite of Victoria) and William
Ewart Gladstone (a Liberal whom Victoria disliked)âfrom 1868 to 1885. In 1876, Disraeli
convinced Victoria to take the title of Empress of India.
Many of Victoria's daughters married into European Royal Houses, giving her the nickname
Grandmother of Europe. All of the current European monarchs descend from Victoria.
Victoria died in 1901, holding the record for longest serving British Sovereign. She was
succeeded by her son Edward, who became King Edward VII. Edward was deemed to belong
not to his mother's House of Hanover, but instead to his father's dynasty, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.
1.34 Edward VII
Edward VII was the oldest person in British history to become King, beginning his reign at
the age of fifty-nine. He participated actively in foreign affairs, visiting France in 1903. The
visit led to the Entente Cordiale (Friendly Understanding), an informal agreement between
France and the United Kingdom marking the end of centuries of Anglo-French rivalry. In
the case of Germany, however, Edward VII exacerbated rivalry through his bad relations
with his nephew, Kaiser Wilhelm II.
Towards the end of his life, Edward was faced with a constitutional crisis when the Liberal
Government, led by Herbert Henry Asquith, proposed the People's Budget. The Budget
reformed the tax system by creating a land tax, which would adversely affect the aristocratic
class. The Conservative landowning majority in the House of Lords broke convention by
rejecting the budget. They argued that the Commons themselves had broken a convention
by attacking the wealth of the Lords. Before the problem could be resolved, Edward VII
died in 1910, allowing his son, George, to ascend to the throne.
1.35 George V
After George became King, the constitutional crisis was resolved after the Liberal Government
resigned and Parliament was dissolved. The Liberals were reelected, in part due to the
unpopularity of the House of Lords, and used the election as a mandate to force their Budget
through, almost too late to save the nation's financial system from ruin.
The Lords paid a price for their opposition to the Liberals, who in the commons passed the
Parliament Bill, which provided that a bill could be submitted for the King's Assent if the
Commons passed it in three consecutive sessions, even if the Lords rejected it. The time
would later be reduced to two sessions in 1949. When the House of Lords refused to pass the
Parliament Bill, Prime Minister Asquith asked George V to create 250 new Liberal peers to
erase the Conservative majority. George agreed, but the Lords acquiesced and passed the
bill quickly.
24
Edward VIII
World War I occurred during George's reign. Due to the family's German connections, the
Royalty began to become unpopular; George's cousin, Wilhelm II, was especially despised.
In 1917, to appease the public, George changed the Royal House's name from the Germansounding Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to the more English Windsor.
In 1922, most of Ireland left the United Kingdom to form the Irish Free State following
the Irish Civil War. The Irish Free State retained the British monarch as a Sovereign, but
functioned as a Dominion of the Crown, with its own Government and Legislature. Six
counties in the Irish province of Ulster remained in the United Kingdom as Northern Ireland.
In 1927, the name of the country was changed from the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
George V died in 1936 and was succeeded by his son, who ruled as Edward VIII.
1.36 Edward VIII
Edward VIII became King in January of 1936 and abdicated in December. His reign was
controversial because of his desire to marry the American Wallis Simpson. Simpson was
already divorced once; she divorced her second husband so she could marry King Edward.
A problem, however, existed because Edward was the Supreme Governor of the Church of
England, which prohibited remarriage after divorce. The Government advised him that he
could not marry while he was King, so he indicated a desire to abdicate and marry Simpson.
The abdication was not unilateral, as the Act of Settlement provided that the Crown go
to the heir of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, regardless of that person's willingness to rule.
Therefore, Parliament had to pass a special Act in order to permit Edward to abdicate,
which he did.
Edward's brother, Albert Frederick Arthur George, became King. He chose to rule as George
VI to create a link in the public's mind between him and the previous Kings of the same
name during a time of crisis. Edward, meanwhile, was made Duke of Windsor and the issue
of his marriage to Simpson were excluded from the line of succession.
1.37 George VI
When George took power in 1936, the popularity of the Royal Family had been damaged by
the abdication crisis. It was, however, restored when George and his wife, Queen Elizabeth,
led the nation and boosted morale during World War II. During the war, Britain was led by
one of its most famous Prime Ministers, Sir Winston Churchill.
Following the War, the United Kingdom began to lose several of its overseas possessions. In
1947, India became independent and George lost the title of Emperor of India. Until 1950,
however, he remained King of India while a constitution was being written. George was also
the last King of Ireland; the Irish established a republic in 1949.
George died in 1952 from lung cancer. His daughter Elizabeth succeeded him.
25
Part I: Political History
1.38 Elizabeth II
During Elizabeth's reign, there have been several important constitutional developments. A
notable one occurred in 1963, when Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan resigned.
There was no clear leader of the Conservative Party, but many favoured Richard Austen
Butler, the Deputy Prime Minister. Harold Macmillan advised the Queen, however, that
senior politicians in the party preferred Alec Douglas-Home, 14th Earl of Home. Elizabeth
accepted the advice and appointed the Earl of Home to the office of Prime Minister, marking
the last time a member of the House of Lords would be so appointed. Home, taking advantage
of the Peerage Act passed in 1963, "disclaimed" his peerage. A Conservative member of
the House of Commons vacated his seat, allowing Home to contest the by-election for that
constituency and become a member of the House of Commons.
There have also been many recent constitutional developments in the nation. The office of
Prime Minister increased greatly in power under the Conservative Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher (the "Iron Lady") and the Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair. Under Blair, many
of Parliament's lawmaking functions were devolved to local administrations in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. In 1999, the House of Lords Act was passed, removing the
automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House.
Elizabeth II continues to reign; her heir is Charles, Prince of Wales.
26
2 Part II: Present System
Unlike most other sovereign states, the United Kingdom does not possess a document expressing itself to be the nation's fundamental or highest law. Instead, the British constitution
is found in a number of sources. Because of this, the British constitution is often said to be
an unwritten constitution; however, many parts of the constitution are indeed in written
form, so it would be more accurate to refer to the body of the British constitution as an
uncodified constitution.
The British constitution is spread across a number of sources:
1. Statute law1
2. Royal prerogative (executive powers usually exercised by Ministers of the Crown)2
3. Constitutional conventions (accepted norms of political behaviour)3
4. Common law (decisions by senior courts that are binding on lower courts)4
5. EU Treaties5
6. Statements made in books considered to have particular authority6
Note that not all of these sources form part of the law of the land, and so the British
constitution encompasses a wider variety of rules, etc. than that of (say) the United States.
Many important elements of the British constitution are to be found in Acts of Parliament.
In contrast with many other countries, legislation affecting the constitution is not subject to
any special procedure, and is passed using the same procedures as for ordinary legislation.
The most important statute law still in force and affecting the constitution includes the
following:
â¢ The Habeas Corpus Act 1679
1 Chapter 2.5 on page 29
2 Chapter 2.1 on page 28
3 Chapter 2.2 on page 28
4 Chapter 2.3 on page 29
5 Chapter 2.4 on page 29
6 Chapter 2.5 on page 29
27
Part II: Present System
â¢ The Bill of Rights (1689)
â¢ The Claim of Right (1689)
â¢ The Act of Settlement (1701)
â¢ The Acts of Union (1707)
â¢ The Septennial Act 1715
â¢ The Acts of Union (1800)
â¢ The Parliament Acts (1911 and 1949)
â¢ The Regency Act 1953
â¢ The Life Peerages Act 1958
â¢ The Peerage Act 1963
â¢ The European Communities Act 1972
â¢ The British Nationality Act 1981
â¢ The Representation of the People Act 1983
â¢ The Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986
â¢ The Human Rights Act 1998
â¢ The Scotland Act 1998
â¢ The Northern Ireland Act 1998
â¢ The House of Lords Act 1999
â¢ The Civil Contingencies Act 2004
â¢ The Constitutional Reform Act 2005
â¢ The Government of Wales Act 2006
2.1 2. Royal prerogative
Certain powers pre-dating the establishment of the present parliamentary system are still
formally retained by the Queen. In practice almost all of these powers are exercised only on
the decision of Ministers of the Crown (the Cabinet). These powers, known as the royal
prerogative, include the following:
â¢ The appointment and dismissal of government ministers
â¢ The summoning, opening, prorogation, and dissolution of Parliament
â¢ The assenting to legislation
â¢ The power to declare war, and to deploy the armed forces
â¢ The power to conduct relations with foreign states, including the recognition of states or
governments, and the making of treaties
â¢ The issuing of passports
2.2 3. Constitutional conventions
Conventions are customs that operate as rules considered to bind the actions of the Queen or
the Government. Conventions are not part of the law, but nevertheless are often considered
to be just as fundamental to the structure and working of the constitution as the contents
of any statute. Indeed, statute law affecting the constitution is often written in such a way
that the existence of certain conventions is taken for granted, and some conventions are so
fundamental that many people are unaware that they are in fact "unwritten" rules.
28
4. Common law
Examples of the more important constitutional conventions include:
â¢ The Queen does not direct government policy, and leaves all decision-making to her
Cabinet
â¢ Cabinet members are bound by the principle of collective responsibility; ministers who
feel themselves unable to publicly support or defend the policy of the Government are
expected to resign
â¢ The Government is headed by a Prime Minister, appointed by the Queen from the House
of Commons
â¢ The Prime Minister is usually expected to be the leader of the political party with the
most MPs (members of the House of Commons)
â¢ When a Prime Minister's political party loses a general election (i.e. obtains less seats in
the House of Commons than a rival party), he or she is expected to resign
â¢ Government ministers are usually expected to be drawn entirely from the two Houses of
Parliament, and most important office-holders are expected to be MPs
â¢ A government that is unable to obtain the passage through Parliament of important
legislation, including the annual Appropriation and Finance Acts, is expected to resign
â¢ The (unelected) House of Lords does not obstruct the passage of legislation stated in the
government party's election manifesto to be fundamental policy
â¢ The Speaker of the House of Commons is expected to be impartial, even though originally
elected as the representative of a political party
2.3 4. Common law
The common law is that part of the law which does not rest on statute. Instead, it is the
accumulation of specific judicial decisions set by senior courts as precedents binding on lesser
courts.
Certain parts of the common law are also what is known as trite law: examples of this
include the fact that the United Kingdom is a monarchy, and the fact that brothers take
precedence over sisters in the succession to the throne.
2.4 5. EU Treaties
As a member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom is bound by EU law.
2.5 6. Authoritative statements
Certain published works are usually considered to have particular authority. In the first half
of the twentieth century this was the case with A V Dicey's Law of the Constitution, being
cited with approval in judicial decisions. A particularly important work is Erskine May,
which sets out the procedures and customs of the House of Commons. Other important
sources include certain ministerial statements.
However, none of these works have legal authority; at best, they are merely persuasive.
29
Part II: Present System
2.6 The Sovereign
The role of head of state in the United Kingdom is held by the Sovereign; the present
Sovereign is Queen Elizabeth II.
2.6.1 Succession to the throne
As a hereditary monarchy, the rules for succession to the throne are established by common
law, as modified by statute.
In accordance with the Act of Settlement (1701), on the death of the Sovereign he or she is
succeeded by his or her "heir of the body"; this operates in accordance with the principle of
male-preference primogeniture. If the Sovereign has only one child, that child succeeds. If
there are more than one children, then the order of succession is determined first by sex, and
then by age. The oldest son always succeeds, even if he has a sister who is older than him.
If the Sovereign dies childless ("without issue") then the order of succession is applied to
their siblings: the oldest surviving brother then succeeds, even if he has a sister who is
older than him. If the Sovereign's siblings have died before he or she died, then the order of
succession works through the sons and daughters of the next oldest deceased brother, and
so on.
Only legitimate children are able to succeed. The Royal Marriages Act 1772 operates to
restrict the capacity for a potential heir to marry without the Sovereign's approval: all
descendants of King George II, other than women who have married into foreign families,
are required to obtain the Sovereign's consent before marrying, unless they can otherwise
obtain approval from both Houses of Parliament.
The Bill of Rights (1689) and Act of Settlement require all heirs to be descendants of Sophia,
Electress of Hanover (d. 1714), and impose further requirements that an heir be a Protestant,
that they may never have married a Roman Catholic, and that they be in full communion
with the Church of England. Heirs not meeting these conditions are skipped over as if
"naturally dead".
2.6.2 The role of the Sovereign beyond the United Kingdom
As Sovereign in right of the United Kingdom, the Sovereign is also head of state in the
"Crown dependencies" of Jersey, Guernsey (and its dependencies), and the Isle of Man. While
the external relations of these islands is dealt with by the United Kingdom, however, they do
not form part of the United Kingdom itself, and have their own constitutional arrangements.
Similarly, the United Kingdom has sovereignty over various territories around the world,
known as the British overseas territories. As such, the Sovereign is also head of state in
these territories, although again these do not form part of the United Kingdom itself, and
have their own constitutional arrangements.
The British Sovereign is also the Sovereign of certain other Commonwealth Realms: Antigua
and Barbuda, Australia, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the
30
Parliament
Grenadines, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. Each of these nations is a separate monarchy;
the Sovereign therefore holds sixteen different crowns. In each nation, the Sovereign is
represented by a Governor-General, who generally stands in relation to the local government
in the same relation as the Sovereign does to the British government.
Finally, the Sovereign has the title Head of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is a
body of nations mostly made up of former colonial dependencies of the United Kingdom.
The role of Head of the Commonwealth is a personal role of the present Queen, Elizabeth II,
and is not formally attached to the monarchy itself (although the present Queen's father,
King George VI, also held the title). The role is purely a ceremonial one.
2.6.3 Royal Family
While the members of the Sovereign's family do not have any role in government, they do
exercise ceremonial functions on his or her behalf.
A male Sovereign has the title "King", while a female Sovereign is the "Queen". The wife of
a King is also known as a Queen; however, the husband of a female Sovereign has no specific
title.
By convention, the Sovereign's eldest son is created "Prince of Wales" and "Earl of Chester"
while still a boy; he also automatically gains the title of "Duke of Cornwall". Also by
convention, the Sovereign's sons receive a peerage either upon reaching the age of twenty-one,
or upon marrying.
The style of Prince or Princess extends to the children of the Sovereign, the children of
the sons of the Sovereign, and the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales.
Furthermore, wives of Princes are styled Princesses, though husbands of Princesses do not
automatically become Princes.
2.7 Parliament
Parliament is the supreme law-making body in the United Kingdom. It is made up of two
Houses of Parliament, namely the House of Commons and the House of Lords, as well as
the Sovereign. The Sovereign's involvement in the life and working of Parliament is purely
formal.
In constitutional theory, Parliament in its strictest sense is sometimes referred to as the
Queen-in-Parliament; this contrasts with the more ordinary use of the term "Parliament",
meaning just the two Houses of Parliament. Within the British constitutional framework,
the Queen-in-Parliament is supreme ("sovereign"), able to make, alter, or repeal any law at
will.
Both Houses of Parliament meet at the Palace of Westminster.
31
Part II: Present System
2.8 Parliaments and Sessions
As with most legislatures, Parliament does not continue in perpetual existence. Typically,
the "life" of a Parliament is around four years.
Parliament is initially summoned by the Sovereign. This now always occurs after there has
been a general election. Once assembled, and a Speaker has been chosen by the House
of Commons, Parliament is formally opened by the Sovereign. The business of the two
Houses is arranged into sessions, which usually last a year (running from around October or
November each calendar year). However, there is usually a long recess during the summer
months, when business is temporarily suspended.
The opening of each parliamentary session is conducted in accordance with a great deal
of traditional ceremony. The Sovereign takes his or her seat on the throne situated in
the chamber of the House of Lords, and the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod (one of
that House's officers) is commanded to summon the House of Commons. When Black Rod
reaches the door of the Commons, it is slammed shut in his face, to symbolise the right of
the Commons to debate without royal interference. Black Rod then solemnly knocks on the
door with his staff of office; on the third knock, the door is opened, and he is permitted to
enter and deliver his message. MPs then proceed from the Commons to the House of Lords,
to hear the Speech from the Throne, more commonly known as the Queen's Speech. The
Speech outlines the Government's legislative proposals for the session; while worded as if it's
the Sovereign's own policy, the Speech is in fact entirely drafted by Government ministers.
Each session is ended by a prorogation. The Commons are formally summoned to the House
of Lords, where another formal Speech is read out, summing up the work of the two Houses
of Parliament over the course of the session. In practice the Sovereign no longer attends for
the prorogation; Lords Commissioners are appointed to perform the task, and one of their
number also reads out the Speech.
By law, each Parliament must come to an end no later than five years from its commencement;
this is known as dissolution. The dissolution is made by royal proclamation. The summoning,
proroguing, and dissolving of Parliament are powers exercised by the Sovereign under the
royal prerogative. They are exercised in accordance with the "advice" of the Prime Minister.
Because a dissolution is necessary in order to trigger a general election, the Prime Minister
is effectively able to choose to hold elections at a time that seems the most advantageous to
his or her political party.
Although the duration of Parliament has been restricted to five years since 1911, legislation
was passed during both World Wars to extend the life of the existing Parliament; this meant
that the Parliament summoned in 1935 eventually continued in existence for around ten
years, until 1945.
32
House of Commons
2.9 House of Commons
2.9.1 Composition
While sometimes described as the "lower house", the House of Commons is by far the most
important of the two Houses of Parliament. Members of the House of Commons are known
as Members of Parliament, or MPs.
The entire United Kingdom is subdivided into constituencies, each of which returns one MP
to sit in the House of Commons. There are presently 650 constituencies, however the exact
number fluctuates over time as the boundaries of constituencies are periodically reviewed
by Boundaries Commissions set up for each part of the UK. Constituencies are intended to
have roughly equal numbers of voters, but in practice the smallest and largest constituencies
can have a significant difference in size.
At each general election all seats in the House of Commons become vacant. If a seat becomes
vacant during the life of a Parliament (i.e. between general elections), then a by-election is
held for that constituency. The election for each constituency is by secret ballot conducted
according to the First-Past-the-Post system: the candidate with the most votes is returned
as MP.
Qualifications of voters
A person must be aged at least eighteen in order to vote.
The following nationalities are entitled to vote at parliamentary elections:
â¢ British citizens
â¢ citizens of the Republic of Ireland
â¢ citizens of Commonwealth countries
Irish and Commonwealth citizens must have been resident in the United Kingdom. British
citizens who are resident abroad are only able to vote if they had been resident in the United
Kingdom within the previous 15 years.
Certain categories of people are unable to vote:
â¢ the Sovereign
â¢ members of the House of Lords
â¢ people serving prison sentences
â¢ persons convicted of "corrupt practices" (electoral malpractice) within the previous five
years
â¢ the insane
By convention, close relatives of the Sovereign also do not vote.
Qualifications of MPs
Anyone who is not disqualified to vote is also qualified to be an MP, except the following:
33
Part II: Present System
â¢ undischarged bankrupts
â¢ persons convicted of treason
â¢ members of legislatures outside of the United Kingdom that are not in Commonwealth
countries
â¢ civil servants
â¢ members of certain specific public bodies, and holders of certain specific statutory offices
â¢ members of the armed forces
â¢ judges
Resignation as an MP
Since the 17th century, the House of Commons has asserted that MPs may not resign.
However, in practice members are able to resign by the legal fiction of appointment as Crown
Steward and Bailiff of the three Chiltern Hundreds of Stoke, Desborough, and Burnham, or
as Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead. Neither of these offices carries any
duties, but have been preserved in force so that those appointed to them automatically lose
their seats in the House of Commons as having accepted an office of profit under the Crown.
2.9.2 Speakership and procedure
The House of Commons is presided over by the Speaker. There are also three Deputy
Speakers, with the titles of Chairman of Ways and Means, First Deputy Chairman of Ways
and Means, and Second Chairman of Ways and Means.
The Speaker and his or her deputies are elected at the commencement of a Parliament,
and serve until its dissolution. Following a general election, the Father of the House (the
member with the longest unbroken service in the House, who is not also a Minister of the
Crown) takes the chair. If the Speaker from the previous Parliament has been returned
as a member of the new Parliament, and intends to continue in office, then the House
votes on a motion that the member take the chair as Speaker. Otherwise, or if the motion
for his or her re-election fails, then members vote by secret ballot in several rounds; after
each round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. The election ends when one
member secures a majority of votes in a particular round. Thereafter, the Speaker-elect
leads the House of Commons to the House of Lords, where the Lords Commissioners (five
Lords representing the Sovereign) officially declare the Royal Approbation (approval) of the
Speaker, who immediately takes office. The Speaker traditionally lays claim to all of the
House's privileges, including freedom of speech in debate, which the Lords Commissioners
then confirm on behalf of the Sovereign.
If a Speaker should choose to resign from his post during the course of Parliament, then he
must preside over the election of his successor. The new election is otherwise conducted
in the same manner as at the beginning of a Parliament. The new Speaker-elect receives
the Royal Approbation from Lords Commissioners; however, the ceremonial assertion of the
rights of the Commons is not repeated.
The Speaker is expected to act impartially. He or she is an important figure within the
House of Commons, controlling the flow of debate by selecting which members get to speak
34
House of Lords
in debates, and by ensuring that the customs and procedures of the House are complied with.
The Speaker and his deputies do not generally speak during debates, nor vote at divisions.
The Speaker also exercises disciplinary powers. He or she may order any member to resume
his or her seat if they consistently contribute irrelevant or repetitive remarks during a debate.
An individual who has disregarded the Speaker's call to sit down may be requested to leave
the House; if the request is declined, then the Speaker may "name" the member. The House
then votes on whether to suspend the member in question for a certain number of days, or
even, in the case of repeated breaches, for the remainder of the session. In the most serious
cases, the House may vote to expel a member. In the case of grave disorder, the Speaker
may adjourn the House without a vote.
The House votes on all questions by voice first. The Speaker asks all those in favour of the
proposition to say "Aye," and those opposed to say "No". The Speaker then assesses the
result, saying "I think the Ayes have it" or "I think the Noes have it", as appropriate. Only
if a member challenges the Speaker's opinion is a division, or formal count, called. During a
division, members file into two separate lobbies on either side of the Commons chamber. As
they exit each lobby, clerks and tellers count the votes and record the names. The result is
then announced by the Speaker. In the event of a tied vote, the Speaker (or other occupant
of the Chair) has a casting vote; however, conventions exist restricting the way in which this
vote is actually cast.
2.10 House of Lords
2.10.1 Composition
Generally speaking, membership of the House of Lords is by appointment for life. However,
up until 1999, hereditary peers were also members of the Lords; when this right was abolished,
a compromise measure allowed them to elect ninety of their number to continue as members.
Certain office-holders are also ex officio members of the House of Lords:
â¢ the Earl Marshal
â¢ the Lord Great Chamberlain
â¢ the Archbishop of Canterbury
â¢ the Archbishop of York
â¢ the Bishops of London, Durham, and Winchester
The Earl Marshal and Lord Great Chamberlain are mostly ceremonial offices. In addition
to the three ex officio bishops, the 21 longest-serving diocesan bishops also sit in the Lords.
The general qualifications for sitting and voting in the Lords are:
â¢ to have reached the age of 21
â¢ to be a British citizen, or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland, or a citizen of a Commonwealth country
â¢ to not have been convicted of treason
â¢ to not have been declared insane
35
Part II: Present System
2.10.2 Speakership and procedure
The Lord Speaker is elected by the House. Until recently his or her duties were carried out
by the Lord Chancellor, a Minister of the Crown.
In contrast with the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Lord Speaker has a relatively
minor role, since the House of Lords is generally self-governing: the House itself decides
upon points of order and other such matters. The seat used by the Lord Speaker is known
as the Woolsack.
Similar to the House of Commons, the Lords also vote by voice first. The Lord Speaker (or
whoever else is presiding) puts the question, with those in favour saying "Content," and those
opposed saying "Not-Content." If the Lord Speaker's assessment of the result is challenged,
a division follows, with members voting in the appropriate lobby just as is done in the
Commons. The officer presiding may vote from his or her place in the chamber rather than
from a lobby. In the case of a tie, the result depends on what type of motion is before the
House. A motion that a bill be advanced to the next stage or passed is always decided in
the positive, while amendments to bills or other motions are decided in the negative, if there
is an equality of votes.
2.11 Acts of Parliament
Legislation passed by Parliament is in the form of an Act of Parliament.
A draft law is known as a Bill. A bill passes into law provided that it has either been passed
by both Houses of Parliament, or the provisions of the Parliament Acts have been complied
with; and provided it has received the Royal Assent.
A bill must pass through several stages in both of the two Houses. A bill is "read" three
times in each House. The First Reading for Public Bills is almost always a formality. The
Second Reading is a debate on the merits of the general principles behind the bill. Next
follow the Committee and Report stages. The Third Reading is a vote upon the bill as a
whole, as amended during the Committee and Report stages. Once the House into which
the bill was first introduced has finished with it, the bill is then introduced into the other
House. Any amendments by the second House then have to be agreed to by the first before
the bill can proceed.
Bills are classified as either Government Bills or as Private Members' Bills. Ministers of the
Crown introduce Government Bills; private members introduce Private Members' Bills.
Bills are also classified as Public, Private, Personal or Hybrid. Public bills create laws applied
generally (for instance, reforming the nation's electoral system). Private bills affect a specific
named company, person or other entity (for instance, authorising major constructions on
specific named public lands). Personal bills are private bills that confer specific rights to
specific named individuals (for example by granting the right to marry a person one would
not normally be allowed to wed). Hybrid bills are public bills that directly and specially
affect private interests.
36
Acts of Parliament
2.11.1 Public Bills
A Public Bill's First Reading is usually a mere formality, allowing its title to be entered in
the Journals and for its text to be printed by the House's authority.
After two weeks, one of the bill's supporters moves "that the bill be now read a second time".
At the second reading debate, the bill's general characteristics and underlying principles,
rather than the particulars, are discussed. If the vote on the Second Reading fails, the bill
dies. It is, however, very rare for a Government bill to be defeated at the Second Reading;
such a defeat signifies a major loss.
In the House of Commons, following the Second Reading, various procedural resolutions
may need to be passed. If the bill seeks to levy or increase a tax or charge, then a Ways and
Means Resolution has to be passed. If it involves significant expenditure of public funds, then
a Money Resolution is necessary. Finally, the government may proceed with a Programme
Motion or an Allocation of Time Motion. A Programme Motion outlines a timetable for
further debate on the bill and is normally passed without debate. An Allocation of Time
Motion, commonly called the Guillotine, limits time available for debate. Normally, a
Programme motion is agreed to by both parties while an Allocation of Time Motion becomes
necessary if the Opposition does not wish to cooperate with the Government. In the House
of Lords, there are no Guillotines or other motions that limit the time available for debate.
Next, the bill can be committed to a committee. In the House of Commons, the bill may
be sent to the Committee of the Whole House, a Standing Committee, a Special Standing
Committee or a Select Committee. The Committee of the Whole House is a committee
that includes all members of the House and meets in the regular chamber. The Speaker is
normally not present during the meetings; a Deputy Speaker normally takes the chair. The
procedure is used for parts of the annual Finance Bill and for bills of major constitutional
importance. More often, the bill is committed to a Standing Committee. Though the name
may suggest otherwise, the membership of Standing Committees is temporary. There can
be from sixteen to fifty members; the strength of parties in the committee is proportional
to their strengths in the whole House. It is possible for a bill to go to a Special Standing
Committee, which is like a Standing Committee except that it may take evidence and conduct
hearings; the procedure has not been used in several years. Finally, the bill may be sent to
a Select Committee. Select Committees are permanent bodies charged with the oversight of
a particular Government department. This last procedure is rarely used; the quinquennial
Armed Forces Bill, however, is always referred to the Defence Select Committee.
In the House of Lords, the Bill is committed to the Committee of the Whole House, a
Public Bill Committee, a Special Public Bill Committee, a Select Committee or a Grand
Committee. The most common committee used is the Committee of the Whole House.
Sometimes, the bill is sent to a Public Bill Committee of twelve to sixteen members (plus
the Chairman of Committees) or to a Special Public Bill Committee of nine or ten members.
These committees correspond in function to the Commons Standing and Special Standing
Committees, but are less often utilised. Select Committees may also be used, like in the
Commons, though it is rare for this to be done. The Grand Committee procedure is the
only one unique to the House of Lords. The procedure is reserved for non-controversial bills
that must be passed quickly; a proposal to amend the bill is defeated if a single member
votes against it.
37
Part II: Present System
In both Houses, the committee used considers the bill clause-by-clause and may make
amendments. Thereafter, the bill proceeds to the Consideration or Report Stage. This stage
occurs on the Floor of the House and offers it an opportunity to further amend the bill.
While the committee is bound to consider every single clause of the bill, the House need
only debate those clauses which members seek to amend.
Following the Report Stage, the motion that the bill be now read a third time is considered.
In the House of Commons, there is a short debate followed by a vote; no further amendments
are permitted. If the motion passes, then the Bill is considered passed. In the Lords,
however, amendments may be moved. Following the vote on the third reading, there must
be a separate vote on passage.
After one House has passed a bill, it is sent to the other for its consideration. Assuming both
Houses have passed a bill, differences between their separate versions must be reconciled.
Each House may accept or reject amendments made by the other House, or offer other
amendments in lieu. If one House has rejected an amendment, the other House may
nevertheless insist upon it. If a House insists upon an amendment that the other rejects,
then the bill is lost unless the procedure set out in the Parliament Acts is complied with.
Once a bill has passed by both Houses, or has been certified by the Speaker of the Commons
as having passed the House of Commons in conformity with the Parliament Acts, the bill is
finally submitted to the Sovereign for Royal Assent. Since 1708, no Sovereign has failed to
grant Royal Assent to a bill. Assent may be given by the Sovereign in person, but is usually
given in the form of letters patent read out in each of the Houses; in the House of Lords the
Clerk announces the Norman French formula "La Reyne le Veult", and the Bill thereupon
becomes an Act of Parliament. In 1708 the formula used for the Scottish Militia Bill was
"La Reyne s'avisera" (however, this was on ministerial advice).
In theory the Sovereign has the right to either withhold or reserve the assent, however this
right is not exercised. If assent were withheld, then the bill would fail. If assent were
reserved, then formally a final decision on the bill has been put off until a later time; if
Assent were not given before prorogation of the session, then the bill would fail.
2.11.2 Private, Personal and Hybrid Bills
In the nineteenth century several hundred private Acts were passed each year, dealing
with such matters as the alteration of local authority powers, the setting up or alteration
of turnpike trusts, etc. A series of reforms has eliminated the necessity for much of this
legislation, meaning that only a handful of private Acts are now passed each year.
A private bill is initiated when an individual petitions Parliament for its passage. After the
petition is received, it is officially gazetted so that other interested parties may support or
contest it. Counter-petitions objecting to the passage of the bill may also be received. To
be able to file such a petition, the bill must "directly and specially" affect the individual. If
those supporting the bill disagree that such an effect exist, then the matter is resolved by
the Court of Referees, a group of senior Members of Parliament.
The bill then proceeds through the same stages as public bills. Generally, no debate is held
on the Floor during the Second Reading unless a Member of Parliament files a "blocking
motion". It is possible for a party whose petition was denied by the Court of Referees to
38
Acts of Parliament
instead lobby a Member to object to the bill on the Floor. After the bill is read a second
time, it is sent to one of two committees: the Opposed Bill Committee if there are petitions
against the bill, or the Unopposed Bill Committee if there aren't. After taking evidence, the
committee may return a finding of Case Proved or Case Not Proved. In the latter case, the
bill is considered rejected, but in the former case, amendments to the bill may be considered.
After consideration, third reading and passage, the bill is sent to the other House, which
follows the same procedure. If necessary, the bill may have to face two different Opposed
Bill Committees. After differences between the Houses are resolved, the bill is submitted for
Royal Assent.
Personal bills relate to the "estate, property, status, or style" or other personal affairs of an
individual. By convention, these bills are brought first in the House of Lords, where it is
referred to a Personal Bill Committee before being read a "first" time. The Committee may
make amendments or even reject the bill outright. If the bill is reported to the House, then it
follows the same procedure as any other private bill, including going through an Unopposed
or Opposed Bill Committee in both Houses. A special case involves bills that seek to enable
marriages between those who are within a "prohibited degree of affinity or cosanguinity".
In those cases, the bill is not discussed on the Floor and is sent at the committee stage
to a Select Committee that includes the Chairman of Committees, a bishop and two lay
members.
Hybrid bills are public bills that have a special effect on a private interest. Prior to the
second reading of any public bill, it must be submitted to the Clerk, who determines if any
of the House's rules have been violated. If the Clerk finds that the bill does have such an
effect on a private interest, then it is sent to the Examiners, a body which then may report
to the House that the bill does or does not affect private interests. If the latter, then it
proceeds just like a public bill, but if the former, then it is treated as hybrid. The first and
second readings are just as for public bills, but at the committee stage, if petitions have
been filed against the bill, it is sent to a Select Committee, but the Committee does not
have the same powers of rejection as Private Bill Committees. After the Committee reports,
the bill is recommitted to another committee as if it were a public bill. Thereafter, the
stages are the same as for a public bill, though, in the other chamber, the bill may have to
be considered once more by a Select Committee.
2.11.3 Supremacy of the House of Commons
Under the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949, the House of Commons is essentially the
pre-eminent chamber in Parliament. If the Lords fail to pass a bill (by rejecting it outright,
insisting on amendments disagreed to by the Commons, or by failing to vote on it), and
the bill has been passed by the Commons in two consecutive sessions, then the bill may be
presented for Royal Assent unless the House of Commons otherwise directs, and provided
that the bill was introduced in the Lords at least one month before the end of each session.
However, twelve months must have passed between the Second Reading in the first session,
and the final vote on passage in the second one. Also, the bill passed by the Commons in
each session must be identical, except to take into account the passage of time since the bill
was first proposed.
39
Part II: Present System
The effect of the procedure set out in the Parliament Acts is that the House of Lords may
delay a bill for at least thirteen months, but would ultimately be unable to overturn the
concerted will of the House of Commons. However, this procedure does not apply in the
case of private or personal bills, nor to bills seeking to extend the life of Parliament beyond
five years.
Under the Parliament Acts, a special procedure applies to "money bills". A bill is considered
a money bill if the Speaker certifies that it relates solely to national taxation or to the
expenditure of public funds. The Speaker's decision is final and cannot be overturned.
Following passage by the House of Commons, the bill can be considered by the House of
Lords for not longer than one month. If the Lords have not passed the bill within that time,
it is submitted for Royal Assent regardless. Any amendments made by the House of Lords
are ignored unless accepted by the House of Commons.
In addition to the Parliament Acts, tradition and conventions limit the House of Lords. It is
the privilege of the House of Commons to levy taxes and authorise expenditure of public
funds. The House of Lords cannot introduce bills to do either; furthermore, they are barred
from amending supply bills (bills appropriating money to expenditure). In some cases,
however, the House of Lords can circumvent the rule by inserting a Privilege Amendment
into a bill they have originated. The Amendment reads:
Nothing in this Act shall impose any charge on the people or on public funds, or vary the
amount or incidence of or otherwise alter any such charge in any manner, or affect the
assessment, levying, administration or application of any money raised by any such charge.
The House of Commons then amend the bill by removing the above clause. Therefore, the
privilege of the Commons is not violated as they, not the Lords, have approved the tax or
public expenditure.
2.12 Delegated legislation
Many Acts of Parliament authorise the use of Statutory Instruments (SIs) as a more flexible
method of setting out and amending the precise details for new arrangements, such as rules
and regulations. This delegated power is given either to the Queen in Council, a Minister
of the Crown, or to other named office holders. An Act may empower the Government to
make a Statutory Instrument and lay it before both Houses, the SI to take legal effect if
approved by a simple vote in each House; or in other cases, if neither House objects within a
set time. In theory, Parliament does not lose control over such statutory instruments when
delegating the power to make them, while being saved the necessity to debate and vote upon
even quite trivial changes, unless members wish to raise objections.
2.13 Privilege
Each House has a body of rights that it asserts, or which are conferred by statute, with the
aim of being allowed to carry out its duties without interference. For example, members
of both Houses have freedom of speech during parliamentary debates; what they have said
40
Structure
cannot be questioned in any place outside Parliament, and so a speech made in Parliament
cannot constitute slander. These rights are collectively referred to as Parliamentary Privilege.
Both Houses claim to determine their own privileges, and are acknowledged by the courts
as having the authority to control their own proceedings, as well as to discipline members
abusing the rules. Furthermore, each House is the sole judge of the qualifications of its
members. Collectively, each House has the right of access to the Sovereign. Individually,
members must be left free to attend Parliament. Therefore, the police are regularly ordered
to maintain free access in the neighbouring streets, and members cannot be called on to
serve on a jury or be subpoenaed as a witness while Parliament is in session. (Arrest for
crime is still possible, but the relevant House must be notified of the same.) Parliament has
the power to punish contempt of Parliament, that is, violation of the privileges and rules of
a House. Any decisions made in this regard are final and are cannot be appealed to any
court. The usual modern penalty for contempt is a reprimand, or brief imprisonment in the
precincts of the House, but historically large fines have been imposed.
2.14 Structure
Her Majesty's Government is the executive political authority for the United Kingdom as
a whole. At its heart is the Cabinet, a grouping of senior Ministers of the Crown, headed
by the Prime Minister. Members of the Government are political appointees, and are
usually drawn from one of the two Houses of Parliament. In addition to the heads of the
Departments of State (most of whom carry the title of Secretary of State), the Government
also includes junior ministers (who bear the title of Under Secretary of State, Minister of
State, or Parliamentary Secretary), whips (responsible for enforcing party discipline within
the two Houses), and Parliamentary Private Secretaries (political assistants to ministers).
When the Sovereign is the King, the Government is referred to as His Majesty's Government; likewise, when there are joint Sovereigns, the Government is known as Their
MajestiesGovernment.
2.15 Prime Minister
The Prime Minister (or "PM") is the head of the Government. Since the early twentieth
century the Prime Minister has held the office of First Lord of the Treasury, and in recent
decades has also held the office of Minister for the Civil Service.
The Prime Minister is asked to form a Government by the Sovereign. Usually this occurs
after a general election has altered the balance of party political power within the House of
Commons. The Prime Minister is expected to have the confidence of the House of Commons;
this usually means that he or she is the leader of the polical party holding the majority
of the seats in the Commons. Since at least the 1920s the Prime Minister himself is also
expected to be a Member of Parliament (i.e. member of the House of Commons). The Prime
Minister retains office until he or she dies or resigns, or until someone else is appointed; this
means that even when expecting to be defeated at a general election, the Prime Minister
41
Part II: Present System
remains formally in power until his or her rival is returned as an MP and asked in turn to
form a Government.
By convention, the Prime Minister and his or her Government is expected to resign if losing
a vote in the House of Commons that has been asserted in advance by the Government as
a matter of confidence; for example, if major legislation is rejected. The same applies if
the Government is defeated by an actual Commons vote of "no confidence". An alternative
option for the Prime Minister in either of these circumstances is to ask the Sovereign for a
dissolution of Parliament, in effect allowing the electorate itself to approve or disapprove of
the Prime Minister's policy. A request for dissolution is usually granted; however, in certain
circumstances the request may be refused, in which case the Prime Minister would again be
expected to resign.
The existence and basis of appointment of the office is a matter of constitutional convention
rather than of law. Because of this, there are no formal qualifications for the office. However,
a small number of Acts of Parliament do make reference to the Prime Minister, and since
the 1930s office has carried a salary in its own right.
The Prime Minister is often an extremely powerful figure within the political system; the
office has been said by some to be an "elected dictatorship", and some Prime Ministers have
been accused of being "presidential". A weak Prime Minister may be forced out of office (i.e.
forced to resign) by his or her own party, particularly if there is an alternative figure within
the party seen as a better choice.
2.16 Cabinet and other ministers
Membership of the Cabinet is not defined by law, and is only loosely bound by convention.
The Prime Minister and (if there is one) the Deputy Prime Minister are always members, as
are the three most senior ministerial heads of Departments of State: the Secretary of State
for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (commonly known as the Foreign Secretary), the
Chancellor of the Exchequer (i.e. the minister responsible for finance), and the Secretary of
State for the Home Department (commonly known as the Home Secretary). Most of the
other heads of departments are usually members of the Cabinet, as well as a small number
of junior ministers.
Ministers of the Crown are formally appointed by the Sovereign upon the "advice" of the
Prime Minister. Ministers are bound by the convention of collective responsibility, by which
they are expected to publicly support or defend the policy of the Government, or else resign.
They are also bound by the less clearly defined convention of individual responsibility, by
which they are responsible to Parliament for the acts of their department. Ministers are
often called upon to resign who either by their own actions, or by those of their department,
are perceived in some manner to have failed in their duty; however, it usually takes sustained
criticism over a period of time for both a minister to feel compelled to resign, and for
the Prime Minister to accept that resignation. Occasionally a minister offers his or her
resignation, but the Prime Minister retains them in office.
Parliamentary Private Secretaries are also bound by the principle of collective responsibility,
even though they hold no ministerial responsibility and take no part in the formation of
42
Privy Council
policy; the position is seen as an initial stepping-stone towards being offered ministerial
office.
2.17 Privy Council
Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council is a ceremonial body of advisors to the
Sovereign. The Privy Council is used as a mechanism for maintaining ministerial responsibility for the actions of the Crown; for example, royal proclamations are approved by the
Privy Council before they are issued. All senior members of the Government are appointed
to be Privy Counsellors, as well as certain senior members of the Royal Family, leaders of
the main political parties, the archbishops and senior bishops of the Church of England, and
certain senior judges.
The Privy Council is headed by the Lord President of the Council, a ministerial office usually
held by a member of the Cabinet. By convention the Lord President is also either the
Leader of the House of Commons, or the Leader of the House of Lords, with responsibility
for directing and negotiating the course of business in the respective House.
Meetings of the Privy Council are usually extremely short, and are rarely attended by more
than a bare minimum of Privy Counsellors.
2.18 Structure
The United Kingdom is made up of three separate legal jurisdictions, each with a separate
laws and hierarchy of courts: England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.
2.19 England and Wales
England and Wales is a common law jurisdiction.
2.19.1 Lower courts
The lowest court in England and Wales is the Magistrates' Court. Magistrates, also known as
Justices of the Peace, are laypersons appointed by the Sovereign. The court hears "summary"
offences (punishable by six months or less in prison). When hearing such cases, three
magistrates sit together as a panel without a jury. In some metropolitan areas, such as
London, there are no magistrates; instead, summary cases are tried by a single District
Judge who is trained in law.
Serious criminal cases are tried before a Crown Court with a judge and a jury of twelve. The
accused may also choose to have certain summary offences referred from the magistrates'
court to the Crown Court, in order for their case to be tried before a jury; the Crown Court
also hears appeals from magistrates' courts. Though the Crown Court is constituted as
43
Part II: Present System
a single body for the whole of England and Wales, it sits permanently at multiple places
throughout its area of jurisdiction.
The counterpart to the Crown and Magistrates' Courts in the civil justice system is the
County Court. There are over 200 County Courts throughout England and Wales.
2.19.2 High Court
The High Court of England and Wales takes appeals from the County Court, and also has
an original jurisdiction in certain matters.
The High Court is constituted into three divisions: the Family Division, the Chancery
Division, and the Queen's Bench Division.
The Family Division is presided over by the President of the Family Division, and hears
cases involving family matters such as matrimonial breakdown, child custody and welfare,
and adoption.
The Chancery Division is presided over by the Chancellor of the High Court (formerly
known as the Vice-Chancellor), and hears cases involving land, companies, bankruptcy, and
probate.
The Queen's Bench Division is presided over by the President of the Queen's Bench Division,
and hears cases involving torts (civil wrongs). The Queen's Bench Division also includes four
subordinate courts: the Admiralty Court (dealing with shipping), the Commercial Court
(dealing with insurance, banking, and commerce), the Technology and Construction Court
(dealing with complex technological matters), and the Administrative Court (exercising
judicial review over the actions of local government). The Queen's Bench Division also has
oversight of the lower courts.
2.20 Court of Appeal
Above the High Court in civil cases, and the Crown Court in criminal cases, is the Court of
Appeal, headed by the Master of the Rolls, and including 35 Lords Justices of Appeal as
well as other judges.
The Court of Appeal is divided into a Civil Division (presided over by the Master of the
Rolls) and a Criminal Division (presided over by the Lord Chief Justice). Generally speaking,
appeals may only be heard "by leave"; that is, with the permission of the either the Court
of Appeal or the judge whose decision is being contested. In some cases, it is possible to
"leapfrog" the High Court and bring a case directly from a County Court.
Together, the Crown Court, the High Court, and Court of Appeal constitute the Senior Courts
(formerly known as the Supreme Court of Judicature). Thus, since they are theoretically one
body, it is possible for judges of one court to sit in other courts. Appeals from the Senior
Courts go to the Supreme Court; it is also possible to leapfrog from the High Court, but
not from the Crown Court. Normally, leave to appeal to the Supreme Court is not granted
unless the case is of great legal or constitutional importance.
44
Northern Ireland
2.21 Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland's system is based on that used in England and Wales, with a similar
hierarchy of magistrates' court, the Crown Court (for criminal trials), county courts (for
civil trials), the High Court, and the Court of Appeal.
Appeals from Northern Ireland lie to the Supreme Court.
2.22 Scotland
In contrast with the rest of the United Kingdom, Scotland uses a mixture of common law
and civil law. Its court system was developed independently of that in England. The Act of
Union (1707) guarantees the continuance of Scotland's different legal system.
2.22.1 Lower courts
Summary jurisdiction is exercised by Justice of the Peace Courts, held either by three
Justices of the Peace (lay magistrates) sitting together, or by a Justice of the Peace sitting
with a legally qualified clerk. As in England and Wales, professional judges may sit in
certain metropolitan areas.
Above the Justice of the Peace Courts are the Sheriff Courts, of which there are around
50. Sheriff Courts hear both criminal and civil cases, and are held before a judge known
as a Sheriff, and have a jury of fifteen people. Sheriff Courts are grouped into six different
Sheriffdoms, headed by a Sheriff Principal who hears appeals from cases not decided by a
jury.
2.22.2 High Court of Justiciary
The highest criminal court in Scotland is the High Court of Justiciary. The judges of
the court are also the judges of the Court of Session (see below); as High Court judges
they are known as Lords Commissioners of Justiciary. The head of the court is the Lord
Justice-General (also the Lord President of the Court of Session), with a deputy known as
the Lord Justice Clerk (who holds the same office in the Court of Session). Altogether the
High Court has up to 32 individual judges.
The High Court has exclusive jurisdiction in serious crimes, such as murder or drug trafficking,
in which case a single judge sits with a jury of fifteen. The High Court also hears appeals
from Justice of the Peace Courts, and hears appeals in criminal cases from Sheriff Courts.
Appeals against decisions by a High Court judge in criminal cases are heard by either two
(in appeals against sentences) or three (in appeals against conviction) High Court judges.
No appeal lies beyond the High Court.
45
Part II: Present System
2.22.3 Court of Session
The highest civil court in Scotland is the Court of Session. Its judges also sit as judges
of the High Court of Justiciary (see above); as Court of Session judges they are known as
Lords and Ladies of Council and Session, or Senators of the College of Justice. The Court
is headed by the Lord President, with a Lord Justice Clerk as deputy. Altogether the Court
of Session has up to 32 individual judges.
The Court of Session is divided into the Outer House (made up of nineteen judges), and the
Inner House (made up of the remaining judges). The Outer House has original jurisdiction,
while the Inner House has appellate jurisdiction. The Inner House is further divided into the
First and Second Divisions, headed by the Lord President and Lord Justice Clerk respectively.
Sometimes, when many cases are before the court, an Extra Division may be appointed.
Each Division may sit as a panel hearing an appeal from the Sheriff Court or from the Outer
House.
Appeals from the Court of Session lie to the Supreme Court.
2.23 Supreme Court
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is the ultimate court of appeal in all civil matters,
as well as in criminal cases (other than from Scotland), and also has original jurisdiction in
devolution cases.
The Supreme Court has replaced the jurisdiction previously exercised by the House of Lords
in the latter's now-abolished judicial capacity. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom
is not to be confused with the Supreme Court of Judicature, the name formerly held by (a)
the Senior Courts, in England and Wales, and (b) the Court of Judicature, in Northern
Ireland.
The Supreme Court is headed by a President, who has a Deputy President. There are a
further ten puisne judges.
2.24 Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council formerly held original jurisdiction in the
United Kingdom in devolution cases, and continues to hold appellate jurisdiction over the
ecclesiastical courts of the Church of England. Appeals to the Privy Council as a court of
last resort also lie from the Crown dependencies, the British overseas territories, and from
certain Commonwealth countries.
Membership of the Judicial Committee is made up of Justices of the Supreme Court, Privy
Counsellors who are or were Lord Justices of Appeal in either England and Wales or Northern
Ireland, members of the Inner House of Scotland's Court of Session, and selected senior
judges from certain other Commonwealth countries. Members retire at the age of 75.
46
ECHR and ECJ
Appeals to Her Majesty in Council are referred to the Judicial Committee, which formally
reports to the Queen in Council, who in turn formally confirms the report. By agreement,
appeals from certain Commonwealth countries lie directly to the Judicial Committee itself.
The Queen-in-Council also considers appeals from the disciplinary committees of certain
medical bodies such as the Royal College of Surgeons. Also, cases against the Church
Commissioners (who administer the Church of England's property estates) may be considered.
Appeals may be heard from certain ecclesiastic courts (the Court of Arches in Canterbury,
and the Chancery Court in York) in cases that do not involve Church doctrine. Appeals may
also be heard from certain dormant courts, including Prize Courts (which hear cases relating
to the capture of enemy ships at sea, and the ownership of property seized from captured
ships) and the Court of Admiralty of the Cinque Ports. Finally, the Queen-in-Council
determines if an individual is qualified to be elected to the House of Commons under the
House of Commons Disqualification Act.
2.25 ECHR and ECJ
In addition to the above domestic courts, there are two further courts which can be said to
exercise a jurisdiction over the United Kingdom.
The European Court of Human Rights deals with cases concerning alleged infringements of
the European Convention on Human Rights.
The European Court of Justice deals with cases concerning alleged infringements of European
Union law.
2.26 Devolution
Devolution refers to the transfer of administrative, executive, or legislative authority to
new institutions operating only within a defined part of the United Kingdom. Devolved
institutions have been created for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales.
Devolution differs from federalism in formally being a unilateral process that can be reversed
at will; formal sovereignty is still retained at the centre. Thus, while the US Congress cannot
reduce the powers of a state legislature, Parliament has the legal capacity to even go so far
as to abolish the devolved legislatures.
Devolution in Wales was originally restricted to the executive/administrative sphere, whereas
in Scotland and Northern Ireland devolution extended to wide powers to pass laws.
2.27 Scotland
The Scottish legislative authority is the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Parliament is
a unicameral body composed of 129 members (called Members of Scottish Parliament, or
MSPs) elected for fixed four-year terms. Each of 73 members is elected by a constituency.
The remaining are elected by eight regions, with each region electing seven members. Each
47
Part II: Present System
voter has one constituency voteâcast for a single individualâand one regional voteâcast
either for a party or for an independent candidate. Regional members are allocated in such
a way as to permit a party's share of the regional vote to be proportional to its share of
seats in the Scottish Parliament.
The Scottish Government is the executive authority of Scotland; it is led by the First
Minister. Other members of the Scottish Cabinet are generally given the title of Minister.
The First Minister must retain the confidence of the Scottish Parliament to remain in power.
Scotland has responsibility over several major areas, including taxation, criminal justice,
health, education, transport, the environment, sport, culture and local government. The
Parliament at Westminster, however, retains authority over a certain number of reserved
matters. Reserved matters include foreign affairs, defence, immigration, social security and
welfare, employment, and general economic and fiscal policy.
2.28 Wales
The National Assembly for Wales is the Welsh legislative authority. It is, like the Scottish
Parliament, a unicameral body; it also uses a similar electoral system. Forty of its sixty
members are chosen from single-member constituencies, while the remaining twenty are
regional members. (There are five regions.) The Welsh Government is led by the First
Minister and includes other Ministers, who must retain the confidence of the Assembly.
The third Welsh Assembly can legislate using a system called "Assembly Measures". This
system is a lower form of Primary Legislation similar to Acts of Parliament. They can
be used to repeal laws, create provision and amend laws. The difference with "Assembly
Measures" and "Acts of the Assembly" is that Measures do not have a bulk of powers with
them, each Measure will come with a LCO, or Legislative Competency Order, which transfers
powers from the UK Parliament to the Welsh Assembly Government. Devolution in Wales
has changed a lot since 1999.
In order for the National Assembly to have full legislative powers, they will need to trigger a
referendum through both the Assembly and both houses of the United Kingdom parliament.
Once done, Wales will for the first time ever, will be able to legislate and make their own
Acts. (To be known as Acts of the Assembly, or Acts of the National Assembly for Wales).
In early 2011, a referendum held in Wales approved the transfer of full legislative competence
to the National Assembly in all devolved matters.
2.29 Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland was the first part of the United Kingdom to gain devolution, in 1921.
However, it has had a troubled history since then, caused by conflict between the main
Unionist and Nationalist communities. Because of this historical background, the present
system of devolution requires power to be shared between political parties representing
the different communities, and there are complex procedural checks in place to ensure
cross-community support for legislation and executive action.
48
General Elections
The Northern Ireland Assembly comprises 108 members elected to represent 18 six-member
constituencies.
The Executive (government) is made up of members from the largest parties in the Assembly,
with ministerial portfolios allocated in proportion to party strengths. The Executive is
headed jointly by a First Minister and Deputy First Minister, who are jointly elected by the
Assembly.
The Assembly's legislative powers are broad, and are similar to those of the Scottish
Parliament (with the notable exception of taxation). The transfer from the United Kingdom's central government of responsibility for the criminal justice system has been highly
contentious, and has only recently been carried out.
2.30 General Elections
Members of the House of Commons are elected in General Elections. General Elections are
called by the Prime Minister. General Elections are held at least once every five years. The
maximum term that a parliament can exist before a new election interrupts it is defined by
parliament. Currently, the Parliament Act7
states that five years is the maximum length.
2.31 Local Elections
From 2007 Scotland will use Single Transferable Vote to elect all of its local councillors.
England and Wales use first past the post or multiple-member first past the post for local
elections. Northern Ireland uses STV for its local elections.
2.32 European Elections
Members of the European Parliament for Northern Ireland are elected using Single Transferable Vote (STV). MEPs for England, Scotland and Wales are elected using the D'Hondt
method.

5 Licenses
5.1 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright Â© 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed. Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft
license for software and other kinds of works.
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change the works. By contrast, the
GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions
of a programâto make sure it remains free software
for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation,
use the GNU General Public License for most of our
software; it applies also to any other work released
this way by its authors. You can apply it to your
programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring
to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software
(and charge for them if you wish), that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you
can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these
things.
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others
from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect
the freedom of others.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass
on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show
them these terms so they know their rights.
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your
rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the
software, and (2) offer you this License giving you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify
it.
For the developersâ and authorsâ protection, the
GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for
this free software. For both usersâ and authorsâ
sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be
marked as changed, so that their problems will not
be attributed erroneously to authors of previous
versions.
Some devices are designed to deny users access to
install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim
of protecting usersâ freedom to change the software.
The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the
area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore,
we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand
ready to extend this provision to those domains in
future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect
the freedom of users.
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by
software patents. States should not allow patents
to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do,
we wish to avoid the special danger that patents
applied to a free program could make it effectively
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program nonfree.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND
CONDITIONS 0. Definitions.
âThis Licenseâ refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
âCopyrightâ also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor
masks.
âThe Programâ refers to any copyrightable work
licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as âyouâ. âLicenseesâ and ârecipientsâ may
be individuals or organizations.
To âmodifyâ a work means to copy from or adapt
all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
copy. The resulting work is called a âmodified versionâ of the earlier work or a work âbased onâ the
earlier work.
A âcovered workâ means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.
To âpropagateâ a work means to do anything with it
that, without permission, would make you directly
or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in
some countries other activities as well.
To âconveyâ a work means any kind of propagation
that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
Mere interaction with a user through a computer
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
An interactive user interface displays âAppropriate
Legal Noticesâ to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells
the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
the interface presents a list of user commands or
options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the
list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code.
The âsource codeâ for a work means the preferred
form of the work for making modifications to it.
âObject codeâ means any non-source form of a
work.
A âStandard Interfaceâ means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized
standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one
that is widely used among developers working in
that language.
The âSystem Librariesâ of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole,
that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of
that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component,
or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source
code form. A âMajor Componentâ, in this context,
means a major essential component (kernel, window
system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a
compiler used to produce the work, or an object
code interpreter used to run it.
The âCorresponding Sourceâ for a work in object
code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run
the object code and to modify the work, including
scripts to control those activities. However, it does
not include the workâs System Libraries, or generalpurpose tools or generally available free programs
which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For
example, Corresponding Source includes interface
definition files associated with source files for the
work, and the source code for shared libraries and
dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate
data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from
other parts of the Corresponding Source.
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code
form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted
for the term of copyright on the Program, and are
irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this
License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges
your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
You may make, run and propagate covered works
that you do not convey, without conditions so long
as your license otherwise remains in force. You may
convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for
you, or provide you with facilities for running those
works, provided that you comply with the terms
of this License in conveying all material for which
you do not control copyright. Those thus making or
running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any
copies of your copyrighted material outside their
relationship with you.
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Usersâ Legal Rights From AntiCircumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law
fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
When you convey a covered work, you waive any
legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with
respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any
intention to limit operation or modification of the
work as a means of enforcing, against the workâs
users, your or third partiesâ legal rights to forbid
circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Programâs
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License
and any non-permissive terms added in accord with
section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices
of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy
that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified
Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or
the modifications to produce it from the Program,
in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
* a) The work must carry prominent notices stating
that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. *
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating
that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement
modifies the requirement in section 4 to âkeep intact all noticesâ. * c) You must license the entire
work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who
comes into possession of a copy. This License will
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This
License gives no permission to license the work in
any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. * d) If
the work has interactive user interfaces, each must
display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the
Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not
make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their
nature extensions of the covered work, and which
are not combined with it such as to form a larger
program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an âaggregateâ if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to
limit the access or legal rights of the compilationâs
users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not
cause this License to apply to the other parts of the
aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form
under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that
you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one
of these ways:
* a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in,
a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding
Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. * b) Convey the
object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three
years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts
or customer support for that product model, to
give anyone who possesses the object code either
(1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange, for a price no more
than your reasonable cost of physically performing
this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no
charge. * c) Convey individual copies of the object
code with a copy of the written offer to provide
the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. * d) Convey the
object code by offering access from a designated
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent
access to the Corresponding Source in the same way
through the same place at no further charge. You
need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place
to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
directions next to the object code saying where to
find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what
server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long
as needed to satisfy these requirements. * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
provided you inform other peers where the object
code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose
source code is excluded from the Corresponding
Source as a System Library, need not be included
in conveying the object code work.
A âUser Productâ is either (1) a âconsumer productâ, which means any tangible personal property
which is normally used for personal, family, or
household purposes, or (2) anything designed or
sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, ânormally usedâ refers to a typical or
common use of that class of product, regardless of
the status of the particular user or of the way in
which the particular user actually uses, or expects
or is expected to use, the product. A product is a
consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or nonconsumer uses, unless such uses represent the only
significant mode of use of the product.
âInstallation Informationâ for a User Product
means any methods, procedures, authorization
keys, or other information required to install and
execute modified versions of a covered work in that
User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to
ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered
with solely because modification has been made.
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User
Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a
transaction in which the right of possession and
use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section
must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither
you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to
provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
modified or installed. Access to a network may be
denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or
violates the rules and protocols for communication
across the network.
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation
Information provided, in accord with this section
must be in a format that is publicly documented
(and with an implementation available to the public
in source code form), and must require no special
password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
7. Additional Terms.
âAdditional permissionsâ are terms that supplement
the terms of this License by making exceptions from
one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program
shall be treated as though they were included in
this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply
only to part of the Program, that part may be used
separately under those permissions, but the entire
Program remains governed by this License without
regard to the additional permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may
at your option remove any additional permissions
from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)
You may place additional permissions on material,
added by you to a covered work, for which you have
or can give appropriate copyright permission.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you
may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
material) supplement the terms of this License with
terms:
* a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this
License; or * b) Requiring preservation of specified
reasonable legal notices or author attributions in
that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
displayed by works containing it; or * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
or requiring that modified versions of such material
be marked in reasonable ways as different from the
original version; or * d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of
the material; or * e) Declining to grant rights under
trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or * f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered âfurther restrictionsâ within the meaning of
section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any
part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a
further restriction, you may remove that term. If a
license document contains a further restriction but
permits relicensing or conveying under this License,
you may add to a covered work material governed
by the terms of that license document, provided
that the further restriction does not survive such
relicensing or conveying.
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with
this section, you must place, in the relevant source
files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to
find the applicable terms.
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive,
may be stated in the form of a separately written
license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work
except as expressly provided under this License.
Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights
under this License (including any patent licenses
granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
However, if you cease all violation of this License,
then your license from a particular copyright holder
is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright
holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright
holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received
notice of violation of this License (for any work)
65
Licenses
from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does
not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.
If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new
licenses for the same material under section 10. 9.
Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely
as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License
grants you permission to propagate or modify any
covered work. These actions infringe copyright if
you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate
your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original
licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
License.
An âentity transactionâ is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all
assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or
merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each
party to that transaction who receives a copy of the
work also receives whatever licenses to the work the
partyâs predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from
the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it
or can get it with reasonable efforts.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the
exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this
License. For example, you may not impose a license
fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim
is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
11. Patents.
A âcontributorâ is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a
work on which the Program is based. The work
thus licensed is called the contributorâs âcontributor versionâ.
A contributorâs âessential patent claimsâ are all
patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
contributor version, but do not include claims that
would be infringed only as a consequence of further
modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, âcontrolâ includes the right
to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent
with the requirements of this License.
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributorâs essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
In the following three paragraphs, a âpatent licenseâ is any express agreement or commitment,
however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such
as an express permission to practice a patent or
covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To
âgrantâ such a patent license to a party means to
make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying
on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source
of the work is not available for anyone to copy,
free of charge and under the terms of this License,
through a publicly available network server or other
readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
cause the Corresponding Source to be so available,
or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
of the patent license for this particular work, or
(3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients. âKnowingly relyingâ means you have actual knowledge that, but
for the patent license, your conveying the covered
work in a country, or your recipientâs use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more
identifiable patents in that country that you have
reason to believe are valid.
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate
by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,
propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the
covered work, then the patent license you grant is
automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
A patent license is âdiscriminatoryâ if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the
exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise
of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under this License. You may not convey a
covered work if you are a party to an arrangement
with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the
third party grants, to any of the parties who would
receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies
of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies
made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with specific products or compilations
that contain the covered work, unless you entered
into that arrangement, or that patent license was
granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No
Surrender of Othersâ Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you
from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence
you may not convey it at all. For example, if you
agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you
convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy
both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use
with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any
covered work with a work licensed under version
3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into
a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue
to apply to the part which is the covered work, but
the special requirements of the GNU Affero General
Public License, section 13, concerning interaction
through a network will apply to the combination
as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License
âor any later versionâ applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either
of that numbered version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide
which future versions of the GNU General Public
License can be used, that proxyâs public statement
of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes
you to choose that version for the Program.
Later license versions may give you additional or
different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later
version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
PROGRAM âAS ISâ WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY
OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,
BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall
apply local law that most closely approximates an
absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection
with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption
of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
return for a fee.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to
be of the greatest possible use to the public, the
best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under
these terms.
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of
each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the âcopyrightâ line and a pointer to where the full
notice is found.
<one line to give the programâs name and a brief
idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year>
<name of author>
This program is free software: you can redistribute
it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU
General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
This program is distributed in the hope that
it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public
License for more details.
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not,
see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
If the program does terminal interaction, make it
output a short notice like this when it starts in an
interactive mode:
<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY
NO WARRANTY; for details type âshow wâ. This is
free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type âshow câ for details.
The hypothetical commands âshow wâ and âshow câ
should show the appropriate parts of the General
Public License. Of course, your programâs commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you
would use an âabout boxâ.
You should also get your employer (if you work
as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a
âcopyright disclaimerâ for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and
how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
The GNU General Public License does not permit
incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is
what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License. But first,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/whynot-lgpl.html>.
5.2 GNU Free Documentation License
Version 1.3, 3 November 2008
Copyright Â© 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed. 0. PREAMBLE
The purpose of this License is to make a manual,
textbook, or other functional and useful document
"free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially
or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered
responsible for modifications made by others.
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means
that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements
the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
We have designed this License in order to use it
for manuals for free software, because free software
needs free documentation: a free program should
come with manuals providing the same freedoms
that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether
it is published as a printed book. We recommend
this License principally for works whose purpose is
instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND
DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work,
in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder saying it can be distributed under
the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated
herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such
manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the
license if you copy, modify or distribute the work
in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any
work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a
front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Documentâs overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook
of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be
a matter of historical connection with the subject
or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of
Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary
then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.
If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text
that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover
Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is
released under this License. A Front-Cover Text
may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text
may be at most 25 words.
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
machine-readable copy, represented in a format
whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for
images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy
made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged
to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
readers is not Transparent. An image format is not
Transparent if used for any substantial amount of
text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
"Opaque".
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent
copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
XML using a publicly available DTD, and standardconforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word
processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD
and/or processing tools are not generally available,
and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or
PDF produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the
title page itself, plus such following pages as are
needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such,
"Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the workâs title, preceding the
beginning of the body of the text.
The "publisher" means any person or entity that
distributes copies of the Document to the public.
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit
of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ
or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ
stands for a specific section name mentioned below,
such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document
means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers
next to the notice which states that this License
applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference
in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty
Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on
the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any
medium, either commercially or noncommercially,
provided that this License, the copyright notices,
and the license notice saying this License applies to
the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that
you add no other conditions whatsoever to those
of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
copies. If you distribute a large enough number of
copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display
copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media
that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Documentâs license notice requires Cover Texts, you
must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly
and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts
on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly
and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
copies. The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible. You may add other material on the covers
in addition. Copying with changes limited to the
covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones
listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the
Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
each Opaque copy a computer-network location
from which the general network-using public has
access to download using public-standard network
protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in
quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
remain thus accessible at the stated location until
at least one year after the last time you distribute
an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
retailers) of that edition to the public.
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
a chance to provide you with an updated version of
the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of
the Document under the conditions of sections 2
and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
Modified Version filling the role of the Document,
thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
* A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if
any) a title distinct from that of the Document,
and from those of previous versions (which should,
if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document). You may use the same title as
a previous version if the original publisher of that
version gives permission. * B. List on the Title
66
GNU Lesser General Public License
Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in
the Modified Version, together with at least five of
the principal authors of the Document (all of its
principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless
they release you from this requirement. * C. State
on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher. * D. Preserve
all the copyright notices of the Document. * E. Add
an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. * F.
Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a
license notice giving the public permission to use
the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. *
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in
the Documentâs license notice. * H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. * I. Preserve the section
Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it
an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title,
year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
sentence. * J. Preserve the network location, if any,
given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
versions it was based on. These may be placed in
the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four
years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
* K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements"
or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section,
and preserve in the section all the substance and
tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
and/or dedications given therein. * L. Preserve all
the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or
the equivalent are not considered part of the section
titles. * M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the
Modified Version. * N. Do not retitle any existing
section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict
in title with any Invariant Section. * O. Preserve
any Warranty Disclaimers.
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter
sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary
Sections and contain no material copied from the
Document, you may at your option designate some
or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add
their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the
Modified Versionâs license notice. These titles must
be distinct from any other section titles.
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements",
provided it contains nothing but endorsements of
your Modified Version by various partiesâfor example, statements of peer review or that the text
has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
You may add a passage of up to five words as a
Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words
as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover
Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may
be added by (or through arrangements made by)
any one entity. If the Document already includes
a cover text for the same cover, previously added
by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added
the old one.
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do
not by this License give permission to use their
names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms
defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
provided that you include in the combination all
of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
The combined work need only contain one copy of
this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there
are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
but different contents, make the title of each such
section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher
of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice
of the combined work.
In the combination, you must combine any sections
Entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".
You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you
follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying
of each of the documents in all other respects.
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH
INDEPENDENT WORKS
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives
with other separate and independent documents or
works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
legal rights of the compilationâs users beyond what
the individual works permit. When the Document
is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are
not themselves derivative works of the Document.
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the
Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Documentâs Cover Texts may be placed
on covers that bracket the Document within the
aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers
if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise
they must appear on printed covers that bracket
the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so
you may distribute translations of the Document
under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections
in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this
License, and all the license notices in the Document,
and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you
also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and
disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
translation and the original version of this License
or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
prevail.
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section
1) will typically require changing the actual title.
9. TERMINATION
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
the Document except as expressly provided under
this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, if you cease all violation of this License,
then your license from a particular copyright holder
is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright
holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright
holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received
notice of violation of this License (for any work)
from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does
not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.
If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all
of the same material does not give you any rights
to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that
a particular numbered version of this License "or
any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that specified version or of any later version that
has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify
a version number of this License, you may choose
any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
this License can be used, that proxyâs public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
11. RELICENSING
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or
"MMC Site") means any World Wide Web server
that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those
works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is
an example of such a server. A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons
Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by
Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in
San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft
versions of that license published by that same
organization.
"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.
An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed
under this License, and if all works that were first
published under this License somewhere other than
this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or
invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated
prior to November 1, 2008.
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an
MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the
same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
To use this License in a document you have written,
include a copy of the License in the document and
put the following copyright and license notices just
after the title page:
Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is
granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no
Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no
Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included
in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation
License".
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts
and Back-Cover Texts, replace the "with . . .
Texts." line with this:
with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and
with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts,
or some other combination of the three, merge
those two alternatives to suit the situation.
If your document contains nontrivial examples of
program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software
license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
5.3 GNU Lesser General Public License
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright Â© 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed.
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, âthis Licenseâ refers to version 3
of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the
âGNU GPLâ refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.
âThe Libraryâ refers to a covered work governed by
this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
An âApplicationâ is any work that makes use of an
interface provided by the Library, but which is not
otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.
A âCombined Workâ is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.
The particular version of the Library with which
the Combined Work was made is also called the
âLinked Versionâ.
The âMinimal Corresponding Sourceâ for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for
the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in
isolation, are based on the Application, and not on
the Linked Version.
The âCorresponding Application Codeâ for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source
code for the Application, including any data and
utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the
System Libraries of the Combined Work. 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3
and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 2. Conveying Modified
Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your
modifications, a facility refers to a function or data
to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of
the modified version:
* a) under this License, provided that you make a
good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part
of its purpose remains meaningful, or * b) under
the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of
the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or
small macros, inline functions and templates (ten
or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the
object code that the Library is used in it and that
the Library and its use are covered by this License.
* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the
GNU GPL and this license document.
4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of
your choice that, taken together, effectively do not
restrict modification of the portions of the Library
contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you
also do each of the following:
* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the
Combined Work that the Library is used in it and
that the Library and its use are covered by this License. * b) Accompany the Combined Work with a
copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. *
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice
for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU
GPL and this license document. * d) Do one of the
following: o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding
Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for,
and under terms that permit, the user to recombine
or relink the Application with a modified version
of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of
the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
o 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for
linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism
is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the userâs computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified
version of the Library that is interface-compatible
with the Linked Version. * e) Provide Installation
Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6
of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such
information is necessary to install and execute a
modified version of the Combined Work produced
by recombining or relinking the Application with
a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you
use option 4d0, the Installation Information must
accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and
Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
4d1, you must provide the Installation Information
in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU
GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work
based on the Library side by side in a single library
together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License,
and convey such a combined library under terms of
your choice, if you do both of the following:
* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy
of the same work based on the Library, uncombined
with any other library facilities, conveyed under
the terms of this License. * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where
to find the accompanying uncombined form of the
same work.
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General
Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General
Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or
concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that
a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License âor any later versionâ applies to
it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not
specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of
the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it specifies that a
proxy can decide whether future versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply,
that proxyâs public statement of acceptance of
any version is permanent authorization for you to
choose that version for the Library.
