1 Introduction
1.1 Disclaimer
When attempting some of the techniques in this book, you may have some frightening
experiences, such as falling sensations or sleep paralysis1
. Although the authors attest these
are not dangerous, you should avoid techniques that create these sensations if you would
prefer not to experience them.
Your own expectations will have a significant effect on your dreams. If you believe that
dream characters act dull and lifelessly, they are far more likely to do so. If you believe they
can be creative, original, and surprising, they are far more likely to be. Remember that the
easier you think it is to dream lucidly, the easier it will be.
Many of the techniques and “facts” presented on these pages are not backed up by scientific
research. This is not to say that these techniques do not work, only that they may be
placebos2 or be ineffective much of the time.

1.2 About dreaming
Figure 1 Stages of sleep
The stages of sleep
Each night, we spend about one and a half to two hours dreaming. We dream about once
every 90 minutes of sleep. The time you spend in dreams becomes longer throughout the
night, from about 10 minutes to around 45 minutes or slightly longer. But what happens
when we sleep?
There are five stages of sleep: four stages of NREM (Non-REM) sleep, also called SWS
(Slow-Wave Sleep), and one stage of REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. The most vivid
4
About lucid dreaming
and remembered dreams occur during REM sleep. Research has shown that a person being
woken from REM sleep will account having just been in a dream roughly 80% of the time,
while this percentage is 15% during non-REM sleep.3 One sleep cycle is roughly 90 minutes
long.
• (NREM 1) The first stage is a transition state between wakefulness and sleep. This is
the stage in which hypnagogic4
imagery occurs. It usually passes into stage 2 within a
few minutes.
• (NREM 2) During stage 2, the body gradually shuts down, and brain waves become
longer in wavelength.
• (NREM 3) Stage 3 usually occurs 30 to 45 minutes after falling asleep the first time.
Large, slow delta brain waves are generated.
• (NREM 4) Stage 4 is often called “deep sleep” or “delta sleep”. The heart beats the
slowest and there is the least brain activity. It is during this stage that sleepwalking
usually occurs.
• After stage 4, the NREM stages reverse and move back to stage 2, and then into REM
sleep.
• (REM) During REM sleep, some parts of the brain are nearly as active as while awake.
In this stage, your eyes flicker rapidly (hence the acronym Rapid Eye Movement). Your
body is paralyzed, preventing the body from acting out dreams.5
After the REM state, you sometimes wake briefly. This is usually forgotten by the time you
wake up in the morning. If you don't wake up, you go to stage 2.
I never dream anyway.
Actually, everyone has dreams — but some people simply don’t remember them. In the next
chapter, you will find out how to improve your dream recall.
Why do we dream? What do dreams mean?
These questions are outside the scope of this book, but you can find several hypotheses in
the Wikipedia article on dream interpretation6
.
1.3 About lucid dreaming
Lucid dreaming is simply being aware that you are dreaming. With enough experience, you
can increase control over your dreams — anything from flying to creating people and places,
and even changing into animals. Having a lucid dream is like being the director of your own
movie! A passage from the fantasy novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (chapter at
King's Cross) that may explain what this looks like:

Introduction
"For the first time, he wished he were clothed. Barely had the wish formed
in his head than robes appeared a short distance away."
Lucid dreams have been scientifically proven to exist. Stephen LaBerge of The Lucidity
Institute7 used a special machine to track eye movements during a dream (these are linked to
your eye movements within the dream). He asked lucid dreamers to point their eyes left and
right in quick succession once they became "conscious" in their dreams, and this movement
was recorded on the machine. For more information on this and other experiments, read
Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming (ISBN in Further Reading8
).
There are plenty of reasons you might want to dream lucidly:
• For fun! Just flying in a lucid dream is an exhilarating feeling. Lucid dreams are generally
far more intense and vivid than most non-lucid dreams. You can use a lucid dream to
wind down after a long day.
• Transforming into animals or getting superpowers is a unique experience that is hard
to get any other way.
• If you are particularly interested in dreams — either spiritually or psychologically —
trying lucid dreaming could help you in your research.
• If you're writing fiction or even creating a world for a computer game, lucid dreaming
can help you visualize it. You could ask your characters how they feel about something
or what they think will happen.
• Some people compose music in their lucid dreams.
• Lucid dreams can be realistic enough to rehearse a speech or musical performance.
• You can relive previous dreams or experiences.
• They can help in dream interpretation and communicating with your subconscious.
I can’t control my dreams.
This is very rarely actually the case (though sometimes it is in nightmares). Usually it is
just your memory which treats you as though it were beyond your control. If you become
lucid in a dream where you have a body, you will almost always be able to control your
body. However, you might not manage to do anything else. Don't worry, though — most
people have no problem with jumping very high or flying in a lucid dream!
On the other hand, parts of your brain are less active while dreaming, which can lead to
dream/trance logic and sometimes choices you will later regret. For example, you might
choose to continue your lucid dream, although you know that once you wake you will only
remember half of it. Once you wake up, you may wish that you had stopped your dream.
Another example is of somebody who dreamt they were sitting next to Mother Theresa.
They wondered if they might be dreaming, thinking isn’t Mother Theresa dead? They then
concluded that she was obviously right next to them and therefore alive, and that it wasn’t
a dream!

About lucid dreaming
There are differing views on this. Some people claim to have organized shared dreams or
precognitive dreams through lucid dreaming. Others say these are simply created in the
brain like any other dream, something like self-hypnosis.
How long does it take to learn how to dream lucidly?
This completely depends on the person and circumstances. Some people have a lucid dream
after just a few nights of learning about it, while for others, it may take months! If you don't
get enough sleep or feel too stressed after work to regularly practice induction techniques,
then it may take a long time, especially if you expect it to. It will also depend on how much
effort you put in. However, everybody has the ability to dream lucidly.
I think I do this naturally. Does this happen?
It is quite rare to have regular lucid dreams naturally, although most people have had a
lucid dream at some point in their lives. If you want to increase the frequency of your lucid
dreams, carry on reading through the book; otherwise, skip to the Using10 section to get
some ideas for your dreams.
I had [a dream], was I lucid?
In general, a lucid dream is defined as a dream in which you know you are dreaming at some
point, regardless of anything else. Even if you were lucid one second but lost your lucidity,
it is still technically a lucid dream.
However, this can be a little misleading. Sometimes you dream that you fall asleep and have
a lucid dream! This is often thought of as a sign that you will have a proper lucid dream
soon, as your mind is thinking a lot about lucid dreams.
Try using this table:
Signs you were lucid Signs you weren't lucid
• Doing a reality check which gave a
positive result
• Attempting to stabilize the dream
(see the Using11 chapter)
• Attempting to fly, walk through mirrors, etc. immediately after realizing
you are dreaming
• Waking up as soon as you realize that
you are dreaming
• Remarks to dream characters that
you are dreaming
• Dreaming that you were dreaming
• Having an unusually poor recall for
that dream after you became lucid
• Not recognizing illogical parts of the
dream as a dream
• Attempting to fly, walk through mirrors, etc. without success
• Treating dream characters as you
would real people*
* However, some people may have lucid dreams and deliberately choose to treat dream
characters as if they were real. In fact, it can be intriguing to have real conversations with

Introduction
dream characters, such as physics or philosophy discussions - you may discover they know
more than you do!
1.4 Possible dangers of lucid dreaming
There is no current evidence of lucid dreaming being abnormal or unhealthy in any way.
However, there may be some more or less minor side effects associated with having lucid
dreams. Please don’t let this scare you away from trying this; rather, remember that
with dreams you are dealing with your own subconscious mind and recklessness is not
recommended.
1.4.1 Addiction
Lucid dreaming can be used for different purposes. Some may want to try it just for fun,
using it as a "safe drug", or a personal virtual reality machine. Having fun is a fully valid
application of lucid dreaming. However, be careful not to be addicted to this way of escaping
your waking life. If you find that you are spending more time asleep than actually needed,
or that you are thinking more about lucid dreams than your real waking life, you might
want to consider taking a look at your life: if you're accomplishing the goals you have for
yourself, and/or are content with the state of your life, there's likely no cause for alarm. If
you see that your life needs work, you might take a break... or, you might use the tools of
lucid dreaming to explore what needs to be done in your life.
1.4.2 Alienation
Most people have never even heard of lucid dreaming, much less ever experienced it. Some
people are also less than open-minded and receptive to new ideas. Don’t be surprised if
someone considers this whole phenomenon “weird” or “crazy” (which it is not). Don’t preach,
either; you don't have to convince anybody.
Often people who spontaneously lucid dream, especially children, may find it surprising that
not everyone does. They may even start thinking that they are the only people in the world
who have lucid dreams. If they’re worried, the best support is to let them know that they’re
not alone.
1.4.3 Dissociation
Lucid dreaming may weaken the borders between waking and dreaming, the conscious and
subconscious mind, reality and fantasy. This might lead to problems of a dissociative nature.
Probably the most common form of dissociation involves having problems distinguishing
your waking memories from dream memories. Everyone who recalls at least one dream will
have to sort out their dreams from reality in the morning. This can really be a problem for
those who have previously had zero recall and, due to lucid dreaming, have had a major
uptick in recall. Now, suddenly, they have all these excess, illogical memories to sort out.
This is unlikely to be a major problem, but may be a big annoyance. An example is
8
Possible dangers of lucid dreaming
when you have actually misplaced an item, and "find it" in a dream. If you cannot distinguish
dream from reality you will now think you know where that item is, perhaps even placed it
where you felt sure to find it later, but when you awake it will not be there.
However, there are signs that you should watch for which indicate a larger problem may be
developing. Lucid dreaming in itself should not cause these to appear in a waking state:
• Ability to ignore extreme pain or what would normally cause extreme pain
• Absorption in a computer game, television program or movie
• Remembering the past so vividly one seems to be reliving it
• Finding evidence of having done things one can’t remember doing
• Not remembering important events in one’s life
• Being in a familiar place but finding it unfamiliar
• Seeing oneself as if looking at another person
• Other people and objects do not seem real
• Looking at the world through a fog or haze
• Not recognizing friends or family members
• Finding unfamiliar things among one’s belongings
• Finding oneself in a place but unaware of how one got there
• Finding oneself dressed in clothes one doesn’t remember putting on
If this has happened, and there is no other cause (e.g. drugs), take a break from lucid
dreaming for a while. In fact, take a break from anything fictional for a while, at least
until symptoms stop. In addition, you may consider avoiding experimentation with lucid
dreaming if you have some form of schizophrenia (although very few schizophrenic people
admit that they are).
PLEASE NOTE: The following possibilities are controversial and have not been proven.
1.4.4 Controversial: Accidentally encountering “spiritual” entities
This depends on your worldview. If dreams are a creation of your brain and nothing more,
you don’t need to worry about spirits or anything similar. If you want to be on the safe
side, treating objects in your dream decently and politely won’t do you any harm.
The book "The Art of Dreaming" by Carlos Castaneda has a lot to say on this subject. (See
Further Reading12)
1.4.5 Controversial: Creating bad habits or becoming a control freak
When lucid dreaming, you have the option to control the dream world in ways that are
impossible in the waking world. You can, for example, make objects appear or disappear, or
make people act according to your will. Some people believe this may lead your subconscious
to desire this kind of control in the waking world, where it’s highly inappropriate. Also, you
might be tempted to apply dream-world solutions to waking-life problems instead of actually
facing them; for example, just willing bad things to go away or escaping or destroying them
12 Chapter 7 on page 65

Introduction
by superpowers. Again, this is probably more of a problem if you are not mentally stable at
the outset of your dreaming process.
1.4.6 Controversial: Exhaustion
Some people believe that experiencing many artificially induced lucid dreams often enough
can be very exhausting. The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of the lucid
dreams expanding the length of time between REM states. With fewer REMs per night,
this state in which you experience actual sleep and your body recovers becomes infrequent
enough to become a problem. This is just as exhausting as if you were to wake up every
twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV. The effect is dependent on how often your brain
attempts to lucidly dream per night. If you enter into a routine of attempting to lucidly
dream, you may cause recursive lucid dreams that occur at each state change.
1.4.7 Controversial: Inability to stop
If you have trained your mind to the point where it can step over the boundary without
conscious effort, you might find it difficult to stop. Do not become alarmed if you have
trouble stopping the process of lucid dreaming, it is possible to get out of the habit. As
long as you truly expect to stop having lucid dreams regularly, you will. You just need to
stop any further attempts to lucid dream, and within a few months the lucid dreaming will
go away by itself. Remember; do not be alarmed if, even with your attempts to stop, you
experience further lucid dreams. It might take a while to break the habit. If you have real
concerns, it may be advisable to talk with your doctor or therapist regarding appropriate
treatment, including medication.
1.4.8 Controversial: Undesirable false awakenings
One of the advantages of having lucid dreams is being able to change a dream or wake up
if things are not turning out as planned. But sometimes, while trying to leave a dream,
you'll get "stuck" in a series of false awakenings. A false awakening is when you seem to
have woken up but are actually still dreaming. For example, you may find yourself waking
up in your room. But once there, new things will start happening—for example, someone
might visit, or you might wander outside because of an odd noise, or there might be objects
all over the place. Then you might realize you're dreaming, but "wake up" immediately, and
the cycle repeats until you eventually do wake up or else dream about something different.
This happens mostly with nightmares or when your body is very tired, so your attempts to
wake up cause false awakenings. It's a good idea to get in the habit of doing a reality check
just after waking up so that you'll realize when this happens and become lucid.
When this happens repeatedly in the same night, it can be very tiring and often frightening.
Not only can the belief of being fully awake in your room while being exposed to unusual
situations be scary, but you also may start fearing you won't be able to actually wake up.
And, depending on the content of the dream, since all your dreams tend to start in your
room, you may fear what could happen once you actually do wake up.

Similar techniques
But this is not a very common situation. Once you are lucid, it is usually easier to wake up
or lose the dream than it is to keep dreaming.
1.5 Similar techniques
I can do astral projection, should I learn how to dream lucidly?
Possibly not. If you often enter a “dream world” after having the experience of leaving your
body, that is basically the same as the method called Wake-Initiation of Lucid Dreams13
.
Keep in mind that many people believe that “astral projection” or “out-of-body experiences”
are actually lucid dreams. Whether these are real psi phenomena14 or the creative product of
your dreaming mind, learning to dream lucidly will expand the variety of your experiences.
If this is so similar, why learn lucid dreaming and not astral projection?
Here are some reasons:
• Lucid dreaming is something that everybody can understand. In fact, most people have
already had a lucid dream. No single theory about astral projection is accepted even in
the astral projection community.
• If you are prepared to spend money, there are some gadgets that can help induce lucid
dreams. They usually emit light or sound signals shortly after the REM state is detected.
Hypnosis tapes usually focus more on self-improvement and you cannot decide what to
do with your hypnotic trance.
• If you don’t believe in psi phenomena15, you will likely be much more comfortable reading
books about lucid dreaming than those on astral projection. If you have to keep stopping
and thinking "but that's not possible", there's always the danger that your feelings of
skepticism will affect the way you think about lucid dreaming and make it much harder
for you to do.
• You would be sleeping anyway, so it doesn't take up waking time.
• You'll be able to use this Wikibook to your advantage!

2 Dream Recall
It is essential to improve your dream recall. There are at least two reasons for this:
1. While it is very rare, it is possible to forget about a lucid dream. It would be
meaningless to invest so much effort into lucid dreaming, only to forget about it upon
waking.
2. Recording your dreams will eventually allow you to start recognizing recurring patterns,
characters, and scenarios. Having these details will be invaluable once you begin
practicing lucid dream induction techniques.
While asleep, we experience a period of REM sleep approximately every 90 minutes. It is
during this time that we typically dream. These periods are initially very brief – only around
10 minutes. But as the night progresses, these periods become increasingly longer - often
stretching to over 45 minutes at a time. Waking up in the midst of dreaming dramatically
increases your ability to remember the details of the dream. Therefore, try setting an alarm
clock to 4 1
2
, 6, or 7 1
2
hours after you normally fall asleep. This should awaken you directly
from a dream.
The most important part of improving your dream recall is keeping a dream journal (or
a dream diary). Virtually any medium will do; an office notebook, artist’s sketchpad, an
online journal, a sheet of paper, or even a Dictaphone — whatever is easiest for you. Here
are some guidelines for keeping your journal:
• Write all your dreams and only your dreams
• Write down everything you can possibly remember about the dream. Phrases, colors,
feelings...everything. Record them as soon as you wake up.
• Sketch pictures into your notebook to help you remember symbols, places, faces, and
other visual dream elements.
• If you wake in the night and have trouble waking up enough to record a dream you can
use the mnemonic technique recommended in Harry Lorayne and Jerry Lucas's "The
Memory Book" of changing something in your room, for example, knocking something
onto the floor, and associating that with an image from your dream. On waking the
displaced object should trigger your memory of the image and so make it easier for
you to remember the dream.
• Ritualise your diary
• Using a dedicated pen in a special color helps to make keeping your journal more of a
ritual.
• You might want to copy out rough notes into a neater dream diary later on in the day.
This helps ingrain the dream in your mind.
• Recall as much as you can while still lying bed
13
Dream Recall
• Go to bed early to ensure that you wake a while before you start your day. In this
free time, mull over any dreams you had and do a reality check1
.
• You may want to keep your eyes closed for as long as possible, particularly if you
wake up near the sunrise. Try to use a notebook which holds a pen and scribble down
whatever you can with your eyes still closed.
• Stay in the same position and run your dreams over in your head a few times before
arising from bed. After you have remembered your dream, move to a different position
(with your eyes still closed) that you normally sleep in, then recall your dream. The
position that you are in may help your brain remember what dream you had while
sleeping in that position.
• If you are still unable to remember anything, allow your mind to wander through
events of yesterday or through any issues you have been thinking about. These may
help to trigger details of your dreams..
• If you share a bed with a partner, make a habit of exchanging dreams upon waking
before talking about anything else.
• Be prepared to record dreams throughout the day
• Keep a small dream diary notebook with you all the time. It is quite easy to remember
a dream in the day and then forget it by the time you get home.
• Even if you only get a fleeting feeling of some dream during the day, note down as
much as you can remember about the dream and what triggered the memory.
• Think about your dream or dreams throughout the day, and ask yourself “What did I
dream?” several times. Often, you only get a good answer to this an hour after you
woke up.
• You can try to remember your dream by “back-tracking” — start from the moment when
you wake up, and try to remember what you were doing before that. You may even be
able to reconstruct your dream to the beginning.
• If you find that many of your dreams are about certain items, such as cars and painting,
then, if you cannot remember your dream in the morning, think about whether it contained
your specific dream signs, in this case, cars and painting. You can even make a “dream
lexicon” — a piece of paper with common dream items written on it, so you can read it
every time you wake up.
Also, use the autosuggestion technique2
to improve your dream recall (see the full description
of the autosuggestion technique in the next chapter).
Once you have a lot of dreams in your diary, you can start looking through it for dream
signs. Some dream signs are commonly experienced by many people. These include things
like flying, being chased, chasing something, or being in an old house. However, a number of
signs will be unique to you. These unique signs may involve meeting with significant people
(from your life), being at your job, or talking with passed away relatives.
Stay alert to any of your dream signs appearing within in real life. And when they happen,
always perform a reality check3
to determine if you are dreaming.
I sometimes remember more dreams than the time I was asleep could allow.
How is this possible?

You may have had several dream scenes within a single dream period or some memories
could be from past nights.
It is also possible that dream time doesn't strictly correspond to real time. Days may pass in a
dream during a single night's sleep. Dreams which seem to last for hours while you have them
have sometimes been found to actually have a duration of only a few minutes. There have been
accounts of people having lucid dreams lasting years: Robert Monroe reported having a lucid
dream that lasted a hundred years. http://www.web-us.com/lucid/luciddreamingFAQ.

You might also be having a memory that was not an actual dream, but rather a waking
memory mistakenly related with dream memories instead of being properly related with
waking memories. Thus, these memories might not be dreams from the past, but rather
ongoing subconscious experiences.
In what order should I write my dreams?
It is usually very hard to tell if the dreams you dreamt happened in the order you recalled
them. Generally they are written in the order remembered, though others may prefer to
write them in a completely random order. Find what works for you. If you dream that you
told somebody about a previous dream that happened the same night, then that previous
dream probably came before the other one (though the “previous dream” could have been a
false memory). The important thing is to write the dream down. Later, if you can recall the
order of the dreams, just go back into your diary and rearrange them.

3 Induction Techniques
This page describes a number of lucid dream induction techniques. It is recommended that
you be able to recall1 at least one dream per night in order to maximize the effectiveness of
these methods.
3.1 Preliminary Knowledge
Certain elements are common to many of the lucidity-inducing techniques discussed later
in this chapter. To better understand these techniques, these common components will be
discussed first.
3.1.1 Sleep Interruption
An element shared by many of the techniques is sleep interruption. Sleep interruption is the
process of purposefully awakening during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short
time later (10−60 minutes). This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock
to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you. If you find yourself resetting the
clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of
bed to turn it off. Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking lots of fluid (particularly
water or tea, a known diuretic2
) prior to sleep, forcing one to get up to urinate.
Sleep interruption is a natural part of the MILD technique (described below) which trains
you to arise immediately after your dreams end.
3.1.2 Sleep Continuity
If you have trouble initially falling asleep, avoid drinking water for about an hour before
going to bed. Otherwise, you may find yourself running to the bathroom, disrupting any
attempts at lucidity. Also, try to avoid caffeine and sugar before bed. However, depending
on your sensitivity, caffeine may only stimulate your mind as opposed to your body. This
extra grip on consciousness could be helpful in inducing lucid dreams. Exercising during the
day is an excellent way of preparing your body for sleep. However, be sure to not exercise
inside the three hours before bedtime, as your body will be stimulated for a short time
afterwards. The morning or afternoon is the best time for this.
1 Chapter 2 on page 13

17
Induction Techniques
If you still have difficulty getting to sleep, try reading about lucid dreaming just before going
to sleep. Your subconscious will likely absorb this information, increasing your chances of
experiencing a lucid dream. If you do decide to read before going to sleep, keep a lamp next
to your bed as physically getting up to turn off the lights may reawaken your body.
3.1.3 Reality checks
A reality check is a test you can perform to see if you're dreaming or awake. It might seem
odd to test reality when you are sure that you're awake, but making a habit out of one or
more of these reality checks will hugely increase your chances of having a lucid dream. If,
say, you hold your nose and try to breathe in through it several times throughout the day
then you're very likely to dream about doing it. And when you dream about performing a
reality check, then of course the results should come out differently, in this case you'll find
that you are somehow breathing in through your closed nostrils. You'll know that you're
dreaming, and be able to take lucid control!
So here are some reality checks. You should be familiar with the entire list even if you only
use a few.

Preliminary Knowledge
Choose a few reality checks which you will do regularly. Take them seriously, do not assume
you are awake (even when you know you are). If you practice performing these checks very
thoroughly while awake, then you're more likely to perform them thoroughly while dreaming.
You should always carry out more than one reality check. If you find that it is not a dream,
look around you and think of what would be different if it were a dream. If you do this it
will make it more likely that you will do a reality check in a dream.
Apart from doing reality checks throughout the day, you also need to do a reality check
immediately after you wake up. This helps you become lucid in false awakenings, when you
dream that you have woken up but in fact are still dozing. Using a digital alarm clock or
mobile phone display to do a Reading check, every single time you wake up, is a quick and
reliable way to catch false awakenings.
If you have trouble bringing reality checks into your dreams then before going to bed imagine
yourself in a dream, noticing odd details and doing a reality check. Then do a reality check
in real life. If you do this a few times before bed you will find that you will do it more often
in dreams.
If you are in a situation where you cannot do a reality check, such as at a public speaking,
try to do one as soon as possible. You can do some reality checks very discreetly, such as
looking at some text on a sign. If you start to say “well, I can't do a reality check now” you
should not be surprised when you make this mistake in a dream!
Which reality checks are best?
When selecting reality checks, the most important properties of a reality check are reliability,
speed, and discreetness.
• The reliability of each reality check is how likely you are to recognize the dream-sign's
results as showing that you are dreaming once you do them in a dream. It changes
for each person but some reality checks are overall more accurate than others. The figures
in the table above are rough only and differ for each person.
• It is important for a reality check to be fast. It wastes dream time if you have to
search around for a book or (perhaps worse) a mirror. Plus, it could also give your
subconsciousness more time to produce real-life results, especially if you believe that the
check will give real-life results.
• Third, a reality check should be discreet; that is, it should not draw too much attention
to you when you do it in the waking world. Suddenly jumping in the air or trying to
walk through a wall as a reality check could cause much embarrassment!
• Fourth, a reality check should not have "false positives". These occur when the reality
check shows you are dreaming in real life. When you get a dream result, do another
reality check to be sure!
• A final important note is whether or not a reality check should have "false negatives".
These occur when a reality check shows you are in real life when you are actually dreaming.
If you think you may be dreaming, keep doing tests until you prove yourself right!
On the table above, these are scored out of 5.
I have trouble remembering to do reality checks throughout the day. What
reminders can I use?
27
Induction Techniques
You are lucky to have an interesting day and forget about lucid dreaming! You can tag
your mind to remember dreaming when you think of certain things, like your friend or your
homework. It isn't advisable to explicitly write “reality check” or “lucid” on your hand, as
this could create an over dependence on this reminder, which may not exist in a dream.
However, you might want to just draw a dot or small circle on your hand. This should be
enough to remind you to do a reality check.
Try putting a little label on your clock, mobile phone, or watch, reminding yourself to do a
reality check. (Some weird colors will make it more noticeable and it will take longer for
you to get used to it and ignore it.) If you check these regularly during the course of your
waking day, you will be doing lots of reality checks.
A simple coffee mug with a reminder such as "Are you dreaming?" printed on it or random
alarms can also serve well, but try not to become too dependent on them. You can find
examples of these at Byte Red15 and LD4All16
.
Another technique is to write down three things you do regularly in a day. Examples include
hearing your name, going through a doorway, turning on a TV, beginning to read a book,
or seeing a stranger. In the morning, choose three such events and intend to do a reality
check whenever they happen in the following day.
I did a reality check in a dream but it said that I was not dreaming. What went
wrong?
Some reality checks work perfectly for some people and awfully for others. These are mostly
the light switches one and the hands one. If you find that the light switch works or that
your hands are perfectly normal, you need to change to a different technique.
I did a reality check in a dream but I did not quite realize I was dreaming.
What went wrong?
An example of this is looking into a mirror and seeing some huge boils or a gray mist on
your reflection and not realizing that you are dreaming. This is rare if you actually intended
to look into the mirror as a reality check. You need to be more careful when doing your
reality checks in real life or pick more reliable reality checks which show more obviously that
you are dreaming. Also try to pick reality checks that are easy to do. For example, don't
rely the Time Reality Check if you never wear a watch, and don't pick the Mirror Reality
Check if you rarely look in the mirror during the day or you know that you won't find a
mirror in your dream.
Another good remedy for this problem (and a good practice in general) is to perform two or
three reality checks at a time. The Time Reality Check, for example, can be easily combined
with attempting to push one hand through another. Or, for those with glasses, testing your
ability to read text fits naturally with checking for "perfect eyesight w/o glasses".

3.2 Techniques
When you read through these techniques, remember that different techniques work for
different people. There is no “best technique” and most techniques could be used to have
2−5 lucid dreams every night! You could have several lucid dreams in a night, but you will
not know it unless you remember them!
However, you will probably want some advice as to which technique you should try first.
Consider whether you want to use a method which starts from a dream or a method which
starts from being awake.*
If you master a technique which starts from being awake, you will
eventually be able to have lucid dreams on demand when you sleep. For other techniques,
you have to rely on your luck to give you lucid dreams after you have done your technique.
Here are some advantages and disadvantages for specific techniques:

* The usual acronyms in forums for this are DILD (Dream-Initiated Lucid Dream) and WILD

on this page.
3.2.1 WBTB
Rated green. This technique has been successful in scientific research and/or is part of
a commercial book about lucid dreaming.
WBTB stands for “Wake-Back-To-Bed”.
Wake yourself up after 4 to 6 hours of sleep, get out of bed and stay up for anywhere between
a few minutes to an hour before going back to bed. It is preferable that you do something
related to lucid dreaming during this time (such as reading about lucid dreaming), but it
is not required. This is best combined with other techniques; many people have amazing
results with a MILD/WBTB combination. The WBTB technique significantly increases your
chances of a lucid dream, and using MILD (see below) in conjunction increases your success
rate if you are planning to sleep an hour or more after your WBTB session. However, you
might need plenty of sleep time and therefore you may only be able to use it on weekends.
If you are sleeping too deeply to become lucid, then you can modify this technique. Try
returning to sleep somewhere different than where you usually sleep, e.g. on a couch, a
different bed, or even on the floor. If you are unable to do this, try changing the way you
sleep, e.g. try sleeping with a lighter blanket or reversing the orientation of your body while
in the bed (that is, swapping head and feet). Do this in order to teach your body that these
different surroundings mean you want to have a more conscious sleep rather than a deeper
sleep. In the beginning, different surroundings will also make you more alert, which can
heighten your level of consciousness during sleep.
I am sometimes awake for very short times, but cannot pull myself together
enough to get up and out of bed. What can I do?
Put a bright piece of paper on the wall or ceiling so that you will see it when you wake
up. Other stimuli could be a hot water bottle, a light turned on under your bed, or an
alarm clock. A good technique is to place an alarm clock out of arm's reach so that you are
compelled to physically get up from bed and turn it off. If this is still insufficient to restore
consciousness, try making a note of your intentions to remain awake and place the note on
your alarm clock. After you get a lucid dream with this method, you'll find it easier and
easier to get out of bed because you'll have more motivation.

Techniques
Rated green. This technique has been successful in scientific research and/or is part of
a commercial book about lucid dreaming.
This technique describes how to use auto-suggestion47 to have lucid dreams. It can be
especially effective for people who are highly susceptible to hypnosis48 or understand
meditation, but for most people, MILD will probably be more effective.
As you are falling asleep, suggest to yourself that you will have a lucid dream either that
night or in the near future. You can use a mantra (such as “I will recognize that I'm
dreaming”) if you want, but make sure you don't try too hard to get a lucid dream. Instead
of putting intentional effort into the suggestion, try to genuinely expect to have a lucid
dream. Let yourself think expectantly about the lucid dream you are about to have, but be
patient if you don't get one right away.
You may also use auto-suggestion to improve dream recall. Just use the technique as
described above, but instead of suggesting that you'll have a lucid dream, suggest that
you'll remember your dreams when you wake up. You could also use a mantra with this,
such as “When I wake up, I will remember what I dreamt”. Just be careful not to put too
much intentional effort into the mantra — try to genuinely expect to remember your dreams
instead.
3.2.3 MILD
Rated green. This technique has been detailed in Exploring the World of Lucid
Dreaming by Stephen LaBerge.
MILD stands for “Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams", or sometimes, “Mnemonically
Induced Lucid Dream". The MILD technique was developed by Stephen LaBerge, and is
described fully in his book Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming.
With the MILD technique, as you are falling asleep, you concentrate on your intention to
remember to recognize that you are dreaming. Repeat a short mantra in your head, such as
“Next time I'm dreaming, I will remember I'm dreaming”. Think about what this means
(i.e., that you want to remember that you are dreaming—in the same way you might go to a
grocery store and suddenly remember that you need bread), and imagine that you are back
in a dream you've had recently, but this time you recognize that you are dreaming. For
example, if you recently dreamed of flying, imagine realizing that it is a dream because you
are flying. Keep repeating and visualizing the mantra until you are sure that your intention
is set in your mind or you fall asleep. If you stop repeating and visualizing the mantra, then
still try to make sure the last thing in your mind before falling asleep is your intention to
remember to recognize that you are dreaming.
In general, the MILD technique can be practiced when you first go to bed at night, or after
you have awakened from a dream during the night. If you practice the MILD technique after
you have awakened from a dream, you should first run through the dream to ensure that
47 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosuggestion
48 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Hypnosis
35
Induction Techniques
you remember it. Some people find it helpful to jot down a few notes about their dream in
their dream journal.
Once you have committed the dream to memory, go back to sleep and follow the steps above.
But this time, visualize the dream you just had. Move through the dream in your mind until
you encounter a dream-sign you originally missed. Now, instead of missing the dream-sign,
imagine yourself recognizing it and becoming “lucid”.
Repeat this until you have fallen asleep. You will re-enter the dream, and you will recognize
the dream-sign and finally, become lucid.

3.2.4 WILD
Rated green. This technique has been successful in scientific research and/or is part of
a commercial book about lucid dreaming.
WILD stands for “Wake-Initiated Lucid Dream”, or “Wake-Initiation of Lucid Dreams” to
refer to any technique that involves falling asleep consciously. These techniques are similar
to self-hypnosis. Some people believe that WILDs are not actual dreams, but are instead
astral projection56. Various detailed resources are available under that moniker.
For most people, they are far easier to induce in the early morning after waking up or
in afternoon naps, as the sleep cycle will continue with a REM period. Once you are
experienced with inducing WILDs, you can try to induce them at other times.
For WILDs to occur, it is best for your body to be completely relaxed. When you go back
to bed, lie down comfortably. Now tense and relax your body, starting from your shoulders
and working downwards, then back up to the face. This (or similar relaxation, meditation,
or trance techniques) should make your body feel slightly heavy and relaxed.
There are many different ways to induce WILDs, but they all involve simultaneously
attempting to keep the mind aware while attempting to have the body fall asleep. A few
techniques are detailed below.

Techniques
If you pay attention to your physical body while using these techniques, then you will likely
enter sleep paralysis (which usually happens after you are already asleep) without losing
conscious awareness of your body. You will get a tingling and buzzing sensation (this might
be unpleasant). These sensations might be so strong that you feel that you will die (e.g., you
might feel a choking sensation), but don't worry, this is perfectly safe! In fact, this process
happens to you every time you sleep, you are just not conscious during it. Sometimes you
can simply wait until you fall asleep straight into a lucid dream. However, if you do not
fall asleep, and you become completely paralyzed (with the exception of your eyes), do not
try to move. Imagine your dream hand (or spirit hand if you prefer) going up and leaving
your physical hand behind. Now you should have two separate bodies, a dream one and a
real one. Control your dream body only — if you control your real one, you will wake up.
Now you can try to roll out of bed into your dream world (alternatively, you can get up and
walk through a mirror, or sink into your bed). There is a possibility that after waking up
from a dream that you initiated using this technique, you may still be paralyzed. If this
phenomenon occurs, it may be accompanied by hallucinations. For example, you may wake
up from a lucid dream that you started using one of the WILD techniques, and you will still
be paralyzed. A dark and scary figure may approach your bed, and you are unable to move,
shout, or scream. Folklores have often given a name to this phenomenon: American people
call it Old Hag57, Japanese people call it kanashibari, Korean people call it kawi nullida
(being pressed by a pair of scissors), and in old French it was called Cauquemare, which
was later transformed into the term cauchemar. Psychic shielding before and/or during the
WILD attempt may be an effective defense mechanism against the negative energies.
Chakra Technique
Rated green/yellow. There have been anecdotes from a few people of this working on
the DreamViews forums58
.
Using Chakra ("third eye") meditation is one way to achieve WILDs. Basically, one has to
focus solely on his third eye and breathing to achieve a lucid dream. This is a technique
over 5000 years old, taught to Parvati by Shiva.59 He is quoted as saying:
With intangible breath in center of forehead, as this reaches heart at the moment of
sleep, have direction over dreams and over death itself.60
Eyelid Patterns
Rated yellow. There have been some anecdotes from at least one person of this technique working, although there is no scientific research proving it.

Induction Techniques
This has been found to be very effective in many cases. However, it may lead to strange
after effects, such as up to 15 dreams in one night, but otherwise, nothing harmful. This
technique is as follows: When you go to sleep, ensure the room is completely dark. Then,
with eyes closed, try to focus on the little dots that should appear to be moving on your
eyelids. You will find that you can change their color at will. Continue focusing on these
dots; make them dance around and form patterns and change colors, and eventually you
should enter a Lucid Dream. This may take a little practice, but is usually very effective
for summoning Lucid Dreams at will. Works better in conjunction with WBTB and other
techniques mentioned above, but is still extraordinarily effective on its own.
Hypnagogic Imagery
Rated green. This technique has been successful with a large amount of people, in
scientific research, and/or is part of a commercial book about lucid dreaming.
Stimulate your thinking patterns by constantly switching your attention. After doing this
long enough, the images and sounds should begin to take a momentum on their own (this is
called hypnagogic imagery), and may they get very strange and illogical. You should enter a
dream at this point and quickly become lucid. Otherwise, you will eventually realize you
have entered sleep paralysis consciously (see above). Because hypnagogic sleep paralysis
involves full consciousness, dreaming can sometimes be frighteningly real. There is often
a feeling of being flipped upside down, spun, or being tugged upon by an outside force.
Hypnagogic hallucinations may also include strange auditory hallucinations, dark beings
and flying. It is possible to observe waking reality while in a hypnagogic state, but this is
limited to the sensations of your physical body. Most hypnagogic sleep paralysis states occur
when sleeping face up. There is evidence that the tendency toward experiencing Hypnagogic
sleep paralysis may be hereditary.
Counting
Rated green. This technique has been successful with a large amount of people, in
scientific research, and/or is part of a commercial book about lucid dreaming.
Another technique is to count up to 100 in your head, optionally adding (for example) an
“I'm dreaming” between each number. Alternatively, you can imagine stepping down stairs
and reading each floor number, from 100 to 0. Try to make this image as vivid as possible
— include not only what you see, but also what you hear, feel (touch the banister), and
smell. At some point this image should continue into a dream or you will begin to get sleep
paralysis as described above. It is easy to lose count, especially with counting up to 100
with an 'I'm dreaming' with each number. But stay focused: you are not going to sleep;
your body is, and you must concentrate fully.

Techniques
Sound Technique
Rated yellow. There have been some anecdotes from at least one person of this technique working, although there is no scientific research proving it. [Important advice
regarding this, may be unsafe, just do one of the other methods instead. See discussion page under Tinnitus]
This method is for people, who can hear the "tinnitus". The idea is pretty much the same as
the other WILD methods, which is to remain conscious while entering the dream state. In
order to use this method, you must sleep in a perfectly quiet place. You need to hear the
inner buzzing sound inside your ears. Lay your body down and relax as much as possible
while trying to hear the sound. If you are too tired, you will fall asleep too fast and it will
be difficult to remain conscious - it this case you should combine it with WBTB. By time
you realize that the buzzing sound will increase in intensity. This might frighten newcomers,
but be assured - nothing bad is going to happen. No, you will not be deaf when you wake
up, it’s perfectly safe! *It is just an effect caused by your brain is trying to change mode,
from listening to the ambient sound, to listening to the sound of dreamland, which is not
real sound but just electrical charge inputed to the part of the brain to create a sensation of
hearing. By that time, you will enter the hypnagogic state. All you need to do is concentrate,
do not be afraid or think of anything, just be still, and in time your dream body will float,
separating from your physical body, and there you go, you arrive in the dreamworld.
Note: These sounds can be heard when you concentrate, even throughout the day - when
you pay attention to them, but they shouldn't be heard much aloud if you are not in silence
and concentrating on it - *as author said. The formula to hear it is quite simple: come
into complete silence close your eyes and listen: is there only absolute silence or is there -
something else? some...? do not create some sound just concentrate - :-) The best thing on
this tech is - you can do it when you want.
Slight Physical Discomfort
Rated yellow. There have been some anecdotes from at least one person of this technique working, although there is no scientific research proving it.
For the purpose of helping to retain your conscious awareness, slight physical discomfort is
useful while performing any WILD technique. This prevents you from just drifting off to
sleep. If you are lying down on your bed to do WILD and you are totally comfortable then
your chances of going to sleep instead of remaining conscious are very high. The WILD
technique relies on a form of deep trance induction, and many people who induce trances
for other reasons rely on slight physical discomfort — for example the lotus position, or
sitting in a hard-backed chair. Depending on your own preferences and your requirements of
discomfort for success, you could choose from the following methods, arranged in ascending
order of discomfort:
1. Stacking pillows so that you can sit up in bed — the discomfort is caused by not being
in a normal sleeping position.
2. Lying down on a hard floor.

3. Lifting your forearm vertically upwards, with the rest of your arm resting on the bed.
4. Sitting in a hard chair.

3.2.5 Incubating Dreams
Rated green. This technique has been successful in scientific research and/or is part of
a commercial book about dreaming.
To incubate a dream about a specific topic, you should first think of a phrase that summarizes
that topic (e.g., “I want to go to Atlantis.”). It may help to write the phrase down. If
there is something you want to do in the dream, think of a phrase to summarize that too
(e.g., “I want to watch Atlantis sink into the ocean.”). If you want to become lucid in the
dream, then you should probably write something like “When I dream of [the topic], I will
remember that I'm dreaming.” beneath your topic phrase. Immediately go to sleep and
focus on your topic phrase. Visualize yourself dreaming about the topic and (if you want to
become lucid) realizing that you are dreaming. If there is something specific you want to do
in the dream, visualize yourself doing it once you become lucid (not very likely to work if
you don't become lucid in the dream). Think about your phrase and topic (and intention to
become lucid) as you fall asleep. Make sure that the last thing in your mind before falling
asleep is your intention to (lucidly) dream about the topic you want to dream about. You
might want to wake yourself up when the dream starts to fade so that you remember more
of the dream; you can do this by ignoring your perception of the dream environment — the

opposite of dream stabilization techniques (just make sure you do a reality check when you
wake up to make sure you are really awake).
Chaining Dreams
Rated green. This technique has been successful in scientific research and/or is part of
a commercial book about dreaming.
Dream-chaining or “chaining dreams” is a method to re-enter your dream after you've woken
up. It can work for lucid and non-lucid dreams, but you will probably want to enter your
dream lucidly.
Once you wake up from a dream (if you don't think you were dreaming before you woke up,
it may not work well) you should stay still and keep your eyes closed. Small movements
are okay, but the less movement, sensory stimulation, and less time awake, the better.
Ideally, it should feel less like you've woken up, and more like you've taken a 30 second
break from dreaming. Once you are prepared to go back to sleep, close your eyes and either
visualize yourself back in your dream, or use the “spinning technique” given in the next
chapter to imagine yourself spinning back “into” your dream. Spinning is a little faster than
visualization. Be sure to maintain the fact that you are dreaming (unless you don't want to
be lucid), or you may lose your lucidity while falling asleep. Once in the dream, stimulate
your senses as early as possible (see the next chapter).
VILD
Rated green/yellow. There have been anecdotes from several people of this working
on the ld4all.com82 forums.
VILD stands for “Visual Induction of Lucid Dreams”, or sometimes, “Visually Incubated
Lucid Dream”. This technique has been perfected by Peter Harrison, known as Pedro on the
forums at ld4all.com83. You may wish to read the main thread about the technique84. The
version described here has been adapted slightly.
First, make sure you are relaxed. You can use the relaxing technique mentioned in the
description of the WILD technique. You can also imagine your brain emptying out and
becoming sleepier. If you have a hard time falling asleep quickly, it should help to read a
book (preferably about lucid dreaming) for a while before you go to sleep, until you feel
very sleepy.
Now, you need to visualize a dream which you had prepared earlier. Here is an example of a
prepared dream:

Induction Techniques
I am in a red room with one door. A friend next to me asks me to show them what a
reality check is. I do my reality checks (which show that I am dreaming), tell them that I
am dreaming, and head towards the door.
Make sure you know exactly what the dream would be like, such as which friend, the exact
words they say, and which reality checks you do. Reality checks that require no props, such
as books or clocks, are recommended. Visualize this dream slowly three times, to make sure
that you know every detail. Then, start going full-on and visualize the dream over and over.
You should visualize the dream as though you are looking through your own eyes, not from
a third-person perspective. If you find your thoughts drifting, ignore them and continue to
visualize the dream continuously. You will need patience for this — don't just give up if you
think it won't work.
When you actually dream this, you will not notice the difference — until you do your reality
checks! Continue with the dream as you incubated it (e.g., remember to thank your friend!)
before continuing through the door.
I tried to visualize the dream until I fell asleep, but I just stayed awake. What
went wrong?
If visualizing keeps you awake, the VILD technique is not the technique for you! You should
use a different technique.

LILD
Rated yellow. There have been some anecdotes from at least one person of this technique working, although there is no scientific research proving it.
LILD stands for “Lucid Induction of Lucid Dreams”, or sometimes, “Lucidly Induced Lucid
Dream”.
To use this technique, you need to have a lucid dream in the first place, but it can help you
to get more later. The idea is to do something in your dream that will help you to become
lucid the next time you are dreaming. For example, you could ask a dream character for

Techniques
help — ask them to meet you the next night and tell you that you are dreaming. If it
works out the way it should, then the next time you are dreaming, the dream character will
walk up to you and tell you that you are dreaming, and so you'll (hopefully) become lucid.
There are many variations on this technique; you could set up signs in your dreamworld that
remind you to do a reality check or eat lucid pills instead! This technique is not likely to be
very effective, but it can work; it relies on the chance that you'll subconsciously induce the
reminder (i.e., the dream character or sign or whatever you used) during some later dream,
and become lucid because of it.
Note that LILD is best used in conjunction with dream-signs and auto-suggested non-lucid
dreams. The basic idea as explained above is to have something in your dream that triggers
the transition from normal dream state to lucid dreaming. To simply tell a character to tell
you that you are dreaming the next time you fall asleep is usually not enough. There is no
guarantee that you will dream about that character and there is no guarantee that your
subconscious will believe the character enough to make you snap into lucidity (make you
realize that you are in fact dreaming).
Now as this technique suggests, you must have some previous alternate means of having a
lucid dream. Whatever technique you employ to get into this initial lucid dream state is not
really important, but you should try to remember to use this technique (LILD) once you do
get into a lucid dream state. Thinking of this before falling asleep (MILD) sometimes helps
and usually takes many lucid dreams before finally remembering. Once you are in a lucid
dream, make up a dream-sign. It can be anything. It can be an object. It can be food or
a drink (that doesn't taste like anything). It is usually best to pick something that isn't
quite right. Something that on the surface would appear normal in the real world, but that
upon closer inspection is not quite right. Food or drinks are good as they can have no taste
or not be refreshing in a dream. But try and pick something that you dream about a lot
so that there is a better chance of you dreaming about this dream-sign later on. Now pick
something else that only appears or happens in your lucid dream. It can be anything. If
there is nothing in your current lucid dream, create something really strange. Something
that could never be confused with the real world. Now mentally associate the dream-sign
(food) with this unusual item or event that could never happen in the real world. But at the
same time, this unusual item or event should equate to "lucid dreaming". When you see the
unusual item, it should only make you think of when you have a lucid dream as this should
be the only time you encountered it. So we have a 3 item associative link. Do all of the
above while in a lucid dream.
The next time you dream about your dream-sign, your subconscious will think of the unusual
item or event. The unusual item or event will make you think of lucid dreaming. The two
combined impossibilities (1. dream-sign that cannot exist in the real world 2. item or event
that only appears in lucid dreams) will make your unconscious try to make a decision on all
this. This will make your conscious mind come to the surface and hopefully you will come
to the conclusion that you are dreaming. Many times, you will not want to deal with it
because you are too tired (that is why you are sleeping, no?) and fall back into a normal
dream state. This is why it can take a few tries. Eventually, your subconscious will start
putting clear signs in your dreams like billboards that spell out "YOU ARE DREAMING".
But once it triggers, it is quite the realization that an instant before, you had no real control
over your actions and now you can do whatever you want. Another note... if it failed, you
will usually know why. So next time, you can choose another dream-sign or slightly different
43
Induction Techniques
technique or something more shocking. Once you get this working once, it is relatively easy
to use over and over as the hard part just described is over with. Sometimes disassociative
techniques are needed if used too much.
To sum up, this technique is a way to force a reality check while in a normal dream state
where your subconscious has no choice but to come to the conclusion that you are in fact
dreaming. Once your mind knows that you are dreaming, there will be no other conclusion
than your conscious mind taking over. And this is what lucid dreaming is all about.
3.2.6 CAT
Rated green/yellow. There have been anecdotes from many different people of this
technique working.
1. For one week, go to bed at the same time each night and get up 90 minutes earlier
than you usually do. Spend those 90 minutes doing reality checks every 2−5 minutes.
2. Thereafter, on alternate days: follow the routine from step one, and set the intention
to do your reality check routine at its regular time, while getting a full night sleep.
This will cause the reality check conditioning to kick in during REM prime-time.

3.2.7 Tibetan methods
Tibetan Buddhists practice what is known as Tibetan dream yoga. Probably the most
time consuming way of inducing lucid dreams, it is also, according to the practitioners,
the most rewarding. The basic practice is awareness. Awareness should be practiced while
sleeping just as well as while being awake. Meditating on the question “who is aware?”
might catapult you into a higher degree of awareness according to Buddhist beliefs. Keeping
this level of awareness is another matter. The Tibetans have developed many yogic exercises
and disciplines to be practiced. Maybe the most interesting difference between Tibetan
dream yoga and modern western methods of lucid dream induction is the Tibetan claim of
the possibility to be aware during deep sleep, not only in the REM periods of sleep. For the
reader who is interested in these methods a good start is to begin to regard all experience
as a dream. After all, from the countless multitude of matter and radiation reaching our
senses the nervous system tunes in only to a small fraction of this chaos. For members of
the phalanx that believes we, more or less, create our own reality in the above sense this

Techniques
practice should feel natural. In general though, it is recommended to gain instruction from
a teacher in the flesh rather than from books (like this one!).
The Tibetan Methods are not "time consuming" if the goal is to go into deeper than Lucid
states. From a Raja Yoga stand point, from a Daoist standpoint, and from a Tibetan Yoga
standpoint the goal is not to "play" in Lucid Dreams, but to dispel the delusional nature of
what we call "reality." Also, to heal and to develop super-learning. Now "super-learning"
is a relative term, it depends on your culture, modernity (in terms of entrepreneurialism -
in 3rd world, 2nd world, 1st world sense; "are you developing a better rickshaw or are you
developing an engine that runs off of water, what is relevant?"), and on the "energy" you
find most attractive: innovative, creative, joyous, blissful, love, power, wisdom, mirth. Are
you Ambitious-Worldly or Ambitious-Spiritual? All these factors play into it.
These techniques are very easy to learn and are rooted in a deeper science than the WILD,
VILD, LILD -- one that does not use auto-suggestion or forced recall. In conclusion, the
Tibetan methods are advanced yogic techniques that only an accomplished practitioner
can fully teach. If one does not have access to a Tibetan dream yogi, one should probably
concentrate on techniques that are more mundane from a Western point of view.
3.2.8 Other techniques
Rated red. There have been no anecdotes found of these techniques working.
Many of these are combinations of other techniques with some addition or modification.
• Inducing dream-signs - You can become lucid by trying to induce specific dream-signs
to watch for during your dream. You can use auto-suggestion (see above) to associate a
specific dream-sign with doing a reality check, or you can just get used to doing a reality
check whenever you encounter the dream-sign while awake. Some dream-signs you can
use:
• Thirst - Avoid drinking for very long. Wake up later in the night and put salt on
your tongue or eat chili to make you even thirstier. Fill a glass of fresh cold water and
take it with you back to bed. Hopefully, you'll dream of getting something to drink.
Don't use this technique if you have trouble falling asleep while thirsty.
• False Awakening - Set your intention as you fall asleep to wake up in the middle
of the night. If you are a heavy sleeper, you'll hopefully dream of waking up in the
middle of the night. If you are a light sleeper, you are probably more likely to really
wake up.
• Bladder - Drink large amounts of water before going to sleep. You should dream of
having to go to the bathroom. You may wet your bed! This technique should be used
carefully, to avoid the possibility of water intoxication97
.
• Conditioning - Strictly punish or reward yourself after a dream where you failed
to realize you were dreaming or when you do have a lucid dream. This could increase
motivation but not necessarily cause lucid dreams in itself. Cognitive psychology, however,
states that this punishment/reward system is very counterproductive, because it ties our
97 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication
45
Induction Techniques
self-esteem to the outcome of the endeavor. The opposite of this system would be to see
each attempt, including those that fail, as another step towards success.
• Muscle Exhaustion - Lift slight weights with one's arms and legs for about fifteen
minutes before one begins to fall asleep. One should not, however, lift anything that
strains the muscles too much, for that stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and
excites the body. The method should cause a release of tension in the muscles and tire
them out. This combined with relaxation techniques and any of the -ILD's should produce
a positive result.
top98
3.3 Other methods
3.3.1 Food and drink
There are various foods and drinks that you can consume which seem to have some effect
on sleeping and dreaming. Note that for most of these there is no explanation or scientific
study of how they work, and some may simply be placebos.
Don't go overboard with the consumption of any of these, as overdosing could have nasty
effects (well, milk should be safe unless you are allergic). Don't experiment without
accumulating enough knowledge first. The authors in no way encourage the use of
legal or illegal drugs.
• The amino acid tryptophan, which can be found in warm milk amongst other sources, is
a precursor for the hormone serotonin, and has been proven to help you fall asleep.
• Vitamin B6 and others of the B group are important for neuronal functions.
• Melatonin99 is a hormone with neuronal effects. It is produced by the pineal gland in
darkness and is suppressed by blue light. Wearing blue-blocking sunglasses or avoiding
bright light in general the hours before bedtime maximizes night-time melatonin secretion.
• 5-HTP100 or L-5-HTP101 is a supplement that is related to serotonin, which some claim
has induced lucid dreaming on approximately half the nights it is taken.
• Caffeine102 is useful in WILD techniques, as it helps the mind stay focused and think
vividly. Please notice that caffeine is an addictive substance and may have negative
effects on your health.
• An Amino Acid103 Blend made up of 2000mg L-aspartic acid, 4000mg L-glutamine, and
300mg L-theanine104 can substantially increase your odds of having a Lucid Dream.
• Galantamine105 - acetylcholinesterase inhibitors extract from plants such as Lycoris

Other methods
Some people who practice Lucid dream (LD) or Out of body experience (OBE) use Galantamine to increase their odds to achieve LD or OBE. By taking small amount of Galantamine
(around 4 to 8 mg) after 5 to 6 hours of deep sleep and practice the induction technique
such as meditation106, MILD or WILD many people report more success with Galantamine.
There also report that taking Galantamine without proper induction technique will not lead
to LD or OBE but will result in only a vivid dream instead. It should also be noted that
due to a long half life Galantamine will stay in the body for a period of up to and over 48
hours, as such it is advisable to space out the use of Galantamine over a period of three
days so that the body does not build a resistance to the drug ruining its effectiveness.
Some people report mixing Galantamine with other Nootropic can enhance the degree of
lucidity but this is still controversial since some mixtures may work for some people, but
lead to failure for others.

3.3.2 Drugs
Dissociatives and hallucinogens can be used to create a (more or less) lucid dream-like state,
though whether or not these help with lucid dreaming is debatable. The authors do not
recommend use of these substances for induction of lucid dreams, nor do they
urge the breaking of any applicable laws.
Some dissociatives and hallucinogens are:
• Amanita muscaria116
• Ayahuasca117
• DMT118 - Common in the shamanic method of drinking Ayahuasca, to the result of
entering the spirit realm. The herbal brew contains the psychedelic DMT, a drug is

3.3.3 Gadgets
There are various gadgets you can use to become lucid easily. They generally detect when
you are in the REM state and then provide a light and/or sound signal. This signal is
supposed to be adjusted so that it doesn't wake you up but does enter your dream. The
signal is then recognized as showing that you are dreaming, and you become lucid.
The most well-known device is the NovaDreamer from the Lucidity Institute. However, this
product is no longer produced. Be sure to check for recommendations for devices from lucid
dreaming forums.
A similar device is the DreamMaker129. The DreamMaker works very similarly to the
NovaDreamer but without the Dream Alarm feature, which worked to wake the dreamer in the
middle of the REM state. This device comes with a mask, a circuit board with adjustable
controls, the batteries needed to operate it, a short owner's manual, a lucid dreaming
workbook, and the Stephen LaBerge130 book Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming. The
circuit board is supplied completely ready to use, but you have to insert the batteries and
put the circuit board into the mask yourself.
An alternative is the Kvasar131. The Kvasar costs about $20 in raw materials, but needs to
be constructed by somebody skilled in electronics as it is not sold commercially. It can also
be hard to operate.

Other methods
Another do-it-yourself alternative to commercial dreaming masks is Nate True's Lucid
Dream Mask132, which does not bother with difficult-to-calibrate sensors and just uses a
timer for flashing lights, and has (ostensibly) competitive results with all of the former
gadgets.

relations; see DreamViews.com133

4 Using
4.1 Dream stabilization
Once you are able to dream lucidly, you may find that it is difficult to stay in the dream; for
example, you may wake instantly or the dream may start “fading” which is characterized by
loss or degradation of any of the senses, especially vision. Alternatively, a new lucid dreamer
could easily forget that they are in a dream, as a result of the shock of the sensation.
Don't worry if you wake immediately after becoming lucid. As you gain more experience of
becoming lucid, it will come as less of a shock and you’ll be less likely to wake up. Make sure
you do a reality check to be sure you’re not still dreaming. As you gain more experience,
you will have an easier time identifying when and remembering that you are dreaming.
You can avoid more gradual fadings by stimulating your senses. This means listening
for sounds, feeling around with your hands, and paying attention to what you see and smell.
The idea here is to load your senses with stimulation from the dream so that your senses
cannot shift to the real world. If you close your eyes, you are removing a great deal of
sensory information and might wake up. Staring at a single point can cause effectively
the same problem if you stop seeing everything else in your peripheral vision, or don't see
enough movement. If you hear something loud in real life and are hearing nothing in the
dream, your senses may shift to the real world, causing you to wake up.
Ideally you should be able to use the techniques below to stabilize your dream before it
starts to fade (or “black out”). As always, prevention is better than treatment - and the
more stable and vivid your dreams are, the more enjoyable they will be. However, if that
doesn't work you may be able to use stabilization techniques to stop the fading; the spinning
technique is probably the most effective in this case.
If you still can’t stabilize your dream, you may decide to try and wake up with the aim of
remembering your dream as accurately as possible while its still fresh in your mind.
4.1.1 Hand Touching
Rub your hands together and concentrate on the rubbing. You should feel the friction and
the heat of your hands. If you can concentrate on the feelings that this action generates,
your dream is likely to stabilize and become more vivid and detailed. You can also keep
one hand on your arm while exploring the dream for a constant sense of stimulation. This
technique is most effective when used in conjunction with the “Slowing it down” technique,
by staring at your hands while rubbing them together.
51
Using
4.1.2 Spinning
You spin around in your dream much as you would if you suddenly want to feel dizzy in
real life. The sensation of movement is the key here to stabilizing the dream. Many people
report success with this technique, but it also tends to cause a complete change of your
dream scene (see Changing the dream environment1 below). If the dream scene disappears
completely (e.g., becomes black), it is necessary to visualize the dreamscape to return to the
dream.
4.1.3 Slowing it down
Some people like to stabilize the dream by “stopping to smell the roses” and slowly staring
at a dream object until it becomes clear. The dreamer would then look around elsewhere,
noticing how detailed everything is, thereby stimulating the visual portion of the dream.
However, others find this can cause their lucid dream to end. If you focus on one object for
too long to the exclusion of everything else, you will likely wake up or lose the dream. It
works best to pay attention to everything in your vision, including your peripheral vision,
not just the center of the object you're staring at. If staring at a single object doesn't work
for you, try to let your eyes wander around instead.
4.1.4 Touching your dream
If you feel that your dream is too abstract and fear that it might be fading, you can prevent
this by grabbing hold of a solid object in your dream and focus on how real the sensation is.
A good tip is to find something you know is stuck, for instance a table nailed to the ground,
and pull it with all your muscular power (no supernatural powers!), and you should feel how
solid it is. The idea is that you convince yourself that the dream is solid and real — through
tactile stimulation — and nothing abstract.
4.1.5 Regaining waking memory or skills
This is also likely to enhance your degree of lucidity. Try to remember facts from your
waking life, such as your phone number, address, etc., or do some simple math. Or, start
reciting the lyrics to your favorite song. Or perhaps try some sports practice you know well
— this all depends on which senses / methods of thought process you tend to rely on most
in your waking life.
4.1.6 False awakening
A couple of the users on the ld4all.com forums have had success with creating a false
awakening to stabilize a dream. If the above techniques are failing and you find your dream
still fading, and you really want to continue your lucid dream, do the following:
1 Chapter 4.3.1 on page 54
52
Recovering from lost visuals
1. Expect to have a false awakening.
2. When you think you wake up, perform a reality check.
You will either have a false awakening, reality check, and then end up with an even more
vivid lucid dream, or will really wake up, perform a reality check, and realize that you just
woke up (bad luck!).
The most important part of this is the reality check. This is what will continue your lucid
dream. You should be performing reality checks when you wake up. If you plan to induce
false awakenings in order to stabilize a dream, the reality check that you perform as you
wake up is as important as the one that got you lucid, if not more.
Perform every check in the book until you are positively, absolutely, and completely
sure that you aren’t dreaming. A series of 10 reality checks is more likely to produce dream
results in a dream, especially if you are expecting dream results. This technique is for those
who are desperate!
If you have had a good experience with this technique, please go to the talk page and post
your experiences, as there have not been many anecdotes of it working yet.
If you didn’t do any of these, your best option is probably to try to wake up. That way, you
will remember more of the dream.
The general rule of dream-stabilization is to stimulate the senses. If you listen for sounds,
feel around with your hands, and pay attention to what you see and smell, you will stimulate
your senses. The idea here is to load your senses with stimulation from the dream so that
your senses cannot shift to the real world. If you close your eyes, you are removing a great
deal of sensory information and might wake up. Staring at a single point can cause effectively
the same problem if you stop seeing everything else in your peripheral vision, or don't see
enough movement. If you hear something loud in real life and are hearing nothing in the
dream, your senses may shift to the real world, causing you to wake up.

4.2 Recovering from lost visuals
There are a few things you can try to do if you lose your vision. Most of these are less likely
to help prolong your dream than the above techniques.
You can also try these if you have just woken up and are lying in your bed. You may be
able to return to your dream.
4.2.1 Autosuggestion
You can repeat over and over a phrase similar to “I can see my dream,” or otherwise enforce
in your mind that you can see a dreamscape. (See Autosuggestion3
)
2 Chapter 4.4 on page 55
3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosuggestion
53
Using
4.2.2 Visualising
You can visualise the scene as it would be if you could see it. You could take this as
an opportunity to change the dreamscape by visualising a different environment from the
previous one in the dream. This can be made easier by spinning as you visualize. (See
Changing the dream environment4 below)
4.3 Altering the dream
4.3.1 Changing the dream environment
You can change the dreamscape by simply visualizing a different environment. Stephen
LaBerge, author of Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming, suggests closing your eyes,
spinning around, and visualizing a new location. Alan Worsley, a famous lucid dreamer,
describes another technique of summoning a television and remote to switched dreamscapes.
By simply “changing the channel” on the remote, imagine your surroundings switching to
your desired location, as though you were switching through various television programs.
In both of these methods, details are key. The more details you provide for your next
dreamscape, the easier it will be to get there. For example, if you wanted go to the
Superbowl in your dreams, you might simply state:
“I want to be at the Superbowl.”
But this statement could be improved by adding details:
"I want be in the endzone seats, drinking a Coke, and wearing my favorite
player's jersey at the Super Bowl."
4.3.2 Summoning objects into your dream
At some point in your lucid dreaming experience, you'll probably want to handle various
objects, or talk with certain people. Both of these needs can be fulfilled by using your mind,
and the power of suggestion. There is no set way to "make" things in the dream world; in
fact, many lucid dreamers devise their own methods through experimentation. However,
here are some of the more common "summoning" techniques:
• Try reaching for objects that are not within your field of vision. For example, think
to yourself: “When I reach into my pocket, there will be a green box of mints.” Then,
attempt to actually take a green box of mints out of your pocket. Other variations of
this include reaching behind you for an object, or reaching through a mirror in hopes of
getting a hold of what you want.
• To summon a person, you might say to yourself: “When I turn around, [person's name]
will be standing in front of me,” or “When I walk through this mirror, I will see [person's
name],” or “In a few moments, [person's name] will walk through that door (or around
that corner).”
4 Chapter 4.3.1 on page 54
54
What you can do
• More experienced lucid dreamers can try making the object materialize right before
their eyes. This will require a fair amount of concentration. Here is an example of this
process:
“I am lucid dreaming in my backyard, and it's currently night. Now, I don't like the dark
in my lucid dreams because I'm more likely to wake up, and I fear there are monsters
lurking around every corner. So, I want to make the sun appear so that it'll be daytime.
Focusing on the horizon, I visualize the sun rising above it.
At first nothing happens, but I continue focusing and...yes! There's some light filtering
over the horizon! And now the sun is rising to the sky and it settles there; so far, so good.
But wait...the sky is still black. Peering at bit closer at the sun, I can just make out a faint
ring of blue sky encircling it. Lifting my hand towards it I shout, "Blue!". The blue ring
quickly spreads across the sky, creating the full daytime effect.”
• Some dreamers may have success by closing their eyes and imagining the desired object
in front of them once when they open their eyes .
• Try using mechanical devices within the dream, such as a nearby lightswitch or button,
to summon objects or people. (i.e. "When I flip this switch/press this button, X will
appear.")
Remember, in the dream world, your expectations shape your surroundings. If you think a
big, scary monster is going to step out of the shadows and attack you...well, a big, scary
monster probably is going to step out of the shadows and attack you. So, don't be a victim;
take control of your thoughts and use them to your advantage. top5
4.4 What you can do
This final section should see you off with a few ideas of what to do in a dream.
It is advised to have a clear purpose for your lucid dreams whenever you go to sleep. In
other words, every night you consider what you want to do when you have a lucid dream,
and select one thing, or perhaps two or three if you are skilled. Avoid this:
"What am I gonna do what am I gonna do? I wanna fly, walk through walls, eat until my
stomach explodes, spy on my neighbours, drive in a car real fast, woooeeey I'm gonna . . ."
You will either end up doing none of these things in your dream or getting overexcited and
waking up.
Now that that’s clear, here’s a list of possible things you could do, ordered in difficulty.
Remember that you might find some things unusually hard (or easy) compared to most
lucid dreamers, this is perfectly normal! This is a very rough guide — if you’ve managed
something in the Easy section, don't be scared to try for something from the Medium section.
5 Chapter 4.4 on page 55
55
Using
4.4.1 Easy
• Fly
Most people enjoy flying around in dreams. There are different styles of flight that
people use, each with a varied level of success for each individual. Methods such as
“swimming through the air”, “Superman style” (one arm outstretched), “Neo style”
(both arms at your side), and “Airplane style” (both arms out) ,"eagle style" (gliding
through the air currents, using your fingered wings to navigate altitudes) are often used.
There are a few methods of getting up into the air, such as simply jumping (you can
jump really high in dreams if you believe it) or imagining a great force pushing you
from your feet or walking up on air as though it is a staircase. Some people summon
jetpacks and slip them on to fly. Be creative and dream up your own methods.
• Explore your dream world
Be warned, you are quite likely to forget you are dreaming when exploring! Doing reality
checks often and muttering to yourself about how real everything seems can help to
avoid this. You can also ask a dream character to tag along with you and remind you
when you forget that you’re dreaming.
• Walk through a mirror or wall
You can pass through dream objects such as walls, glass, trees, and everything else.
Confidence is really the key here. Some variations on going through stuff can be going
in slowly, wiggling your finger in first, or running quickly into the object and telling
yourself you would go through it. Some people particularly like to go through mirrors
because of the unpredictable effects this action produces. However, if you tell yourself
you will end up at a certain location before passing through a mirror, you can change
the dream scene quickly. Be warned, some people experience nothing and wake up after
passing through. You may want to hold your arm to keep yourself in the dream.
• Look at the sky
People often report amazing skies in lucid dreams. You can also shout colors at it and
paint some sunrises.
• Show off to your friends (“Hey guys; I can go through this wall!”)
• Do plenty of sports (trampolining, skiing, swimming, dancing, etc.)
• Use various power such as Telekinesis and magic (a shortcut if you are having problems
would be to summon a magic wand/staff or other device)
• Try to read a book that you have never read and remember the content
• Try to browse the Internet and visit sites that you've never visited
• Use things that you have never used
• Last but not least: Edit Wikipedia/Wikibooks articles (see question 90 of the Wikipediholic Test6
) and see if the changes remain when you awake!
4.4.2 Medium
• Eat until you’re near bursting!
• Teleport
• Create some dream characters (possibly from a book or film)
• Try to find your spirit guide
6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AAre%20You%20a%20Wikipediholic%20Test
56
What you can do
• Experiments (in fact, researchers will often want people of various skills)
• Body swapping/possession (where you enter a different body)
• Morph
• Take some drugs (this is more realistic if you’ve done so in real life)
Many people have also experienced realistic effects when trying drugs in dreams that
they have never taken in real life.
• Drive a vehicle (This is especially fun if you haven't ever driven in real life)
• Fight
Nobody can tell you what you should and should not do in your dreams; the choice
remains up to you.
• Use weapons
It is usually more interesting to use melee weapons (knives, swords, brass knuckles)
than projectile weapons. Machine guns and pistols often run out of ammo and summoning it can be difficult. Misfires and jamming is also common. (Your subconscious
expectations will shape your dreamscape in all manner of ways, If you believe it
is hard to accomplish, if you believe it will jam or misfire, it will. I have had no
issues with weaponry such as firearms in my dreams what-so-ever, take this "advice"
lightly.) However this can be overcome by using Directed Energy Weapons (Lasers,
Plasma/pulse rifles), or weapons that can't jam (bows, simple firearms like muskets
and so on).
• • "Beat up" your enemies
4.4.3 Hard
• Have sex
The excitement, or closing your eyes, can cause you to wake up. An additional reason
for waking up may be fixing your eyes on your partner, as holding a gaze for long is also
known to cause waking up. Also your dream partner has a strange way of transforming
in the midst of ecstasy. Finding a sex partner isn't very hard, it's keeping them that
is difficult. That is why it is best to not panic when they are transforming and accept
them for what your subconscious brings you.
• More morphing like 360 degree vision, sonar vision7
, etc.
• Create false memories, etc. False memories can be made by having a lucid dream, but
scripting it so you will think it is real, e.g. you think what happened in your dream
happened in real life. This is hard because you will have to forget it is a dream while
staying lucid (knowing it is a dream).
• Compose music or poems (or request them from your subconscious)
• Build a fantasy dream world! (some people build a dream world naturally)
• Lucid Crossroads8
• Astral Pulse Island9
• H.P. Lovecraft's Dreamlands10
7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sonar
8 http://lucidcrossroads.co.uk
9 http://www.astralpulse.com/astralpulseisland.html
10 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamlands
57
Using
• Have precognition (your subconscious can be very good at predicting the future with
relationships and career)
• Experience death. This could be a very harsh experience, and depending on your religious
or philosophical beliefs may summon you into a different world or nothingness.
• Ask the dream to show you your worst fears/deepest traumas/etc. (be prepared for some
bad stuff to surface)
• Build/use impossible objects, such as hypercubes11, Klein bottles12, etc.
• Rewind time

Separate Reality, and Journey to Ixtlan. After six years of study and meditation, Carlos
has now written what may be his most significant book of all, The Art of Dreaming - a
book that fully explores how those on a spiritual quest can use "the fourth gate" of dreams
as a two-way hatch to other worlds. With The Art of Dreaming, you will learn, as Carlos
did, how finding the way to alternate realities through the consciousness of dreams is the
essence of the great sorcerers; how ancient, remarkable, and sometimes dangerous beings
now live among us; and how don Juan's training allows two or more people to dream and
explore together. You will witness an adventure of the psyche unlike any other you've ever
experienced, and you will participate fully in Castaneda's latest discoveries and explorations
- discoveries and explorations that are as eye-opening and thrilling as anything he's ever
written about before. Most of all, however, you will be utterly captivated by the story of
this man's remarkable life and journeys of the soul; journeys that could only come from
the teachings of don Juan, and the writings of Carlos Castaneda.

This book is the summary of the experiences of some experienced lucid dreamers. It's not
written from the same viewpoint as many of the more mystical books on the subject, which
is both interesting, as they report on their experiences in detail without trying to influence
you, and discouraging, in that they do not believe it is equally easy or possible for everyone
to dream lucidly.

When using the counting technique for induction, I always stop counting at
some point and crash. The other techniques have their own little issues I can't
work out (being a programmer, this really puts my nads in a salad shooter).
Are there any computer programs I can run on a laptop that will somehow
remind me that I am dreaming?
--Vampirism441
(talk2
) 22:59, 10 May 2009 (UTC) Yes, there are computer programs you
can use. Just look at the software section in induction techniques. As for the counting
technique, when you "crash", simply start counting from 1 again.
Lucitity has become chance for me, and even then it only occurs once every
two weeks. Is there anything I can try to make it a 80% possibility per night?
As lucid dreams are rare for me, this little bug really sucks. I gain lucidity,
and when I try to give my dream a basic command (Like turning my hands
blue, or making my sister explode), I wake up as the command takes effect.
Even when I focus on something (my hands or the explosion), I wake. How do
I combat this?
When doing some things (that wont work in real life) I sometimes start to slip out of it.
What I do is just stop for a second (as the dream has become simply me with my eyes closed,
imagining things) and just relax. Dont do any fast movements and soon you'll slip back into
your little fantasy of blue hands and exploding siblings

FAQ
Why do people want to move during sleep paralysis? I have had it about 3
times and have never tried to move.
Because for many of the people who experiance this it is entirely accidental and so it is not
a comfortable feeling at all. I have had sleep paralysis on roughly 4 occasions, all of them
when I was younger except for one time around six months ago and none of them occured
on purpose.
I use the MILD, WILD, and counting induction processes at the same time. I
experience sleep paralysis as "I'm breathing in, but I cant breathe out", and
when ym lungs are full, it's REALLY uncomfortable. Also, if I stay this way
for 20 secs, my entire room seems to twist, and I see a strange "screensaver"
type thing. When I finally breathe out, everything clears, and I become
lightheaded. Is there a chance that this is normal?
Probably. A lot of weird things happen during sleep paralysis (frequently including discomfort), and I've never heard of anyone actually getting hurt or dying because of sleep
paralysis. Just relax.
Is it possible to use the WILD process with a little background noise? (Small
pets moving in their cage, 20Db)
Some actually prefer to have some background noise. They concentrate on the noise, after
some time, it becomes distorted.
I keep losing lucidity after I try to do something after "pausing" a lucid dream.
How do I combat this? (Eg, pausing, then slapping the person in front of me,
and I can't seem to lift my hand)
--Vampirism443
(talk4
) 00:29, 6 May 2009 (UTC) If you can't move your hand after slapping
somebody, this is not losing lucidity. Rather, you probably regained the sense of your
physical body and tried to move it rather than your dream body. To combat this, try
focusing on the dream as much as possible and then try to move your hand. If this doesn't
work, than try to genuinely believe that you will be able to move your hand in your dream,
relying on the Placebo effect.
For how long do u have to experience the buzzing sensation in WILD before
you become paralyzed?
anon: For me the paralysis goes pretty much hand in hand. After like a minute of buzzing I
start to feel like I'm falling through my bed. If i try waking up after the "falling through my
bed" has started, I almost every time end up having sleep paralysis. This freaked me out a

lot of times in the beginning. Now, whenever i get the buzz, I just try to wait for it and let
myself float away till my dream starts. Of course this could also be a placebo for me.
A few of my normal dreams have had some good imagery, but none have had
real vividness (e.g. proper sound, the brush of air etc.). I have not had a lucid
dream, to the best of my ability, but am trying. Is it likely that a lucid dream
would be more realistic in terms of my perceptions than a normal dream?
Xgamer45
: Not just likely. That's almost always the case. I'm not sure why that is though.
One way to actually stay lucid is to, in-fact, focus on something in the dream. A wall, flower,
plant, anything, and it helps keep you lucid.
Exabyte6
: I think that we don't remember normal dreams in much detail because we often
don't pay much attention to those details (brush of air, fans running, etc.) in waking life, so
our brains don't think to create them. When we are lucid, however, we often want to see
how realistic dreams can be, so we look for details that we don't normally pay attention
to. Thinking of these details causes our brains to create them. That's just my speculation,
though.
Also, take into account that, altough we perceive the world through the 5 senses, generally
only one of them is the main neural path into the brain, so the other senses get, like, dimmed
as our brain dedicates more resources to that main sense. What this means is that you can
remember more of a dream's visuals but only some of the hearings, or more of the hearings
but none of the touch; as a matter of fact, as far as I have known, few people remember the
tastes of their dreams.
Ksd57
: We don't remember normal dreams in much detail, because when we are sleeping,
our memory receptors are not as active.
Could someone please describe the sensation of sleep parilysis during WILD?
Because I keep getting close to falling asleep while counting but I jerk myself
awake because I suddenly think 'I'm gonna choke' or 'I won't be able to
breathe!', And I want to be fully prepared for it.
vodkeiro: I once had a sleep parilysis. I'm not sure if I was trying to have a Lucid Dream.
What happened to me was that, I was having a nightmare, so I started to think loudly
(inside the nightmare) "I wanna leave this place, NOW!". Suddenly, I woke up, I was in my
room, and as it happens when someone has a nightmare, i tried to sit on my bed. There
was the problem, I couldn't move, I "moved", but on the next second, I was again at the
beggining, like when in a game, where you die and go back to the beggining as if nothing
had happened. I tried to yell, scream, shout, everything, but nothing happened. After a
few tries, I could move, but I was still a little scared. So, I don't think you'll think "I'm
gonna choke", as you'll get really scared by not being able to move, so you're probably not
thinking anything else.

FAQ
Azmisov: Whenever I go into sleep paralysis my eyes start to flutter very rapidly and I
see bright flashes of light. I have never had a painful deathly experience, although it can
sometimes be a little uncomfortable. Usually, (I guess it depends on the person) it will last
less that 30 seconds. This also depends on how fast you can transition into a lucid dream or
astral travel.
When going into your dreams using WILD you may feel things like
vibrations, falling and yes, choking.these are perfectly normal and
more importantly safe. just stay calm and the feelings will
eventually stop.
Alessandro (chemicalpoem@yahoo.it)
I have had lot of sleep paralysis, and I was very scared about it: goonna choke, gonna die,
cannot move, arhg! But, after reading 'bout LD I got very interested in this phenomena
and I started to wait fot getting it again. Just this night (I was very tired, it was 5o clock)
it happened again. I just remained really quiet, enjoing this sensation: if you get sure that
nothing is gonna harm you, 't's like a fantastic total body orgasm!Then I've had THREE
consecutive LD, two false awakening and a long, long and very clear dream. So, just keep
quiet and IMAGINE!

--118.92.27.1988
(talk9
) 12:34, 18 December 2007 (UTC) I have experienced sleep paralysis a
few times, the first time was after a lucid dream, I saw myself in a white bed with me(in
reality I was sleeping on the couch) from side view, and didn't feel like moving untill after I
woke up; I was 3/4 asleep so I didn't panic. the second time was after a non-lucid dream
that ended in me pressing a red button, I heard strange highly pleasant music, felt emotions
of euphoria and tranquility, and saw a scary, conspicuously sharp toothed monster leaning
over me. The other times I don't remember. Everything I've read about sleep paralysis has
said something different, so I guess it varies from person to person.
For the last 3 years I have been getting what I thought was sleep paralysis,
but since learning about lucid dreaming, I think my experiences are a form or
at least a gateway to lucid dreaming. Is there a link between the two? (in
short, i know that I am dreaming but often the dream is of me lying in my
bed in my room, or a place similar to my room, so it can be confusing. It is
unpleasant, as I feel a strong desire to wake up from the dream state but
can't. I usually try screaming, or moving vigorously- i can't move properly or
just roll off my bed(in the dream))
Tharenthel10: What's most important is to not doubt (even slightly) that you can move, and
you'll be able to move. In a dream, whatever you believe you can do, you can do (though
it can be hard to convince yourself of that sometimes). If you have trouble completely
convincing yourself that you can move, you could try treating the dream sleep paralysis like

real sleep paralysis. Use the WILD technique (while paralyzed in the dream) to separate
your paralyzed dream body and a second "spirit" dream body (read the paragraph about
sleep paralysis in the WILD section11).
How good should your dream recall be before you attempt lucid dream
induction techniques?
Xgamer12: You should be remembering at least 1 dream every night though more is better.
The main thing though is to just try when you are comfortable. Due to placebo you might
get a lucid dream with less than that if you believe.
evilshiznat13: Trying out the induction techniques is probably good while getting better at
recall. It'll help you get used to it more, and once you get to one dream per night, you'll be
all set.
KC14: Developing your dream recall above zero is obviously necessary, but you better set
your own pace. You could start trying the induction techs out right away, just don't be
disappointed if you don't get immediate results.
I have difficulty telling the difference between dreams and reality - not during
the dream itself, but when I remember things. Can I exploit this to induce
lucid dreams?
Xgamer415: While I can't say I know much about it, having difficulty telling differences
between dreams and real life in a memory happens to me also. It tends to be a common
occurrence I think. It's even mentioned somewhere else here. On actually using it to induce
a lucid dream, you could try incubating a dream. Other than that, I really don't know. Try
stuff though and see if it works. If it does, tell us. If not, well, you tried.
Is that possible to have a dream about having a lucid dream? I had a dream
in which I had done a reality test and it showed that it was a dream. I walked
through the wall, but I was too scared to jump from the window. In my
nearly-lucid dreams I never think what I am doing, even when it is something
strange. I just do. When I wake up, I often remember my dreams as if I were
someone else watching myself in dream. Is that normal?
--118.92.27.19816 (talk17) 12:42, 18 December 2007 (UTC) One question at a time mate. You
cannot have a dream about having a lucid dream, that would be a lucid dream. I advise you
to jump out of the window next time, doing something you are scared to do in a dream often
has amusing results. It is normal to remember dreams as if you are someone else watching

yourself, it's such a common feature in a dream that someone should come up with a name
for such a dream.
I suggest you ignore the above comment, it is certainly possible to have a lucid dream about
having a lucid dream. I can attest to this from experience. This will feel like a normal dream,
which is what you seem to be describing. You may be aware that concentrating on a subject
heavily will often influence your dreams - if you have been studying for a difficult test, you
might have a dream about passing or failing it. If you have been recently been enjoying the
company of a new girlfriend or boyfriend, they may appear in your dreams too. Likewise, if
you have been looking into lucid dreaming and consciously focusing on it, you may have a
dream that you are lucid dreaming. Don't read into it too much. --124.169.35.17918 (talk19)
My dreams are often very realistic, e.g. I feel the wind blowing. But when I'm
dreaming, I act like in a real life! I can't recognise my dreams that they are
dreams. I've found out about lucid dreams about a month ago. I'm trying to
have one, but I never had. What can I do to recognise my dreams as a dreams
and have at last lucid dream? (Sorry for my English, I'm still learning! ;))
Tharenthel20: Other than trying some of the induction techniques21, your best bet is probably
to get in the habit of doing reality checks at certain times throughout the day. For example,
you might do a reality check every time you wake up, use an elevator, or drive a car. It's best
to choose events that happen frequently in your dreams, obviously. Keeping a dream journal
will help your subconscious get used to any differences between your dreams and waking life
(there probably are some subtle differences, even if you don't notice them), and improve
your dream recall—you might have already had a lucid dream but just never remembered
it! (I've had lucid dreams and not remembered them until hours after I woke up before, so
it's definitely possible.) Also, if you have any books on lucid dreaming, reading one just
before you go to sleep can help a lot since you'll be thinking about it as you fall asleep.
Sometimes I've had dreams where I think I know I'm dreaming, but I still
have limited control. I can never fly or anything, even though I actually try.
Is there anything I can avoid just 'dreaming' that I know I'm dreaming?
You must suspend all disbelief when attempting to do out of the ordinary things in a dream.
Jumping off a building or a staircase is a good way to force yourself to fly. With time, you
can just jump and fly wherever you want. Personally, during my first lucid experience, I
couldn't move my body at all, but I got the hang of it eventually.

This almost seems religious, the idea of becoming your own god in your
dream. What effect does Lucid Dreaming have on your spiritual life?
Xgamer422: I honestly can't say. Being Mormon, it doesn't seem to affect me very much.
Mormons believe we were put on this earth to experience everything we possibly can in a
life time and to return to living with the creators and helpers. To me, LDing, heck, just
dreaming in general, is a way to experience many more things we couldn't experience in real
life. I mean seriously, in real life, when are you going to get to fly around the world freely,
or get chased by some scary thing then confront it, and it tells you why it's chasing you, or
be chased by a lion in the middle of a jungle, or talk to people about anything while not
worrying about being embarassed or ashamed of what you did, or etc.?
KC23: Lucid dreaming in itself will not have an effect on your spiritual life, unless you
want to use it for such a purpose (soul-searching and such). However, fear is one of the
biggest obstacles in your way to lucid dreaming, and so are negative expectations. You
are the person who controls your spiritual life, but if you need counseling, seek it from a
proper representative of your own religion. My personal advice would be to drop any extra
religious/spiritual baggage before you try lucid dreaming, but it's your choice.
[Gene] Lucid Dreaming is an essential indicator of higher awareness in many spiritual systems.
See Ken Wilber, Buddhism, Ramana Maharshi. The ability to remain self-identified in
dreaming sleep and (non-dreaming) deep sleep indicates awareness of higher bodies, the
subtle self and the causal Self, respectively. This is normally achieved only after many years
of meditation (which itself can be said to be a practice of release from object-relations).
Dreaming sleep is a subtle body (mental) experience and deep sleep is a causal body
(spiritual) experience. Most people associate their waking state awareness as "consciousness",
but this is a consciousness that is formed in a context of object-relations, which objects help
to identify "me" and "not me". When there are no perceived (external) objects, such as in
deep sleep, can you identify your Self? It is a milestone of human development when infants
achieve object constancy (maintain awareness of where an object is even if it is no longer
in view), and is is also a milestone of development, though rarely achieved, to maintain
self awareness even in the midst of no perceptions, ie. deep sleep. (e.g. even in a sensory
deprivation chamber, one can perceive or feel their body). Ramana Maharshi (probably
acknowledged as a true spiritual adept across more religions and spiritual disciplines than
anybody) said "if it's not real in deep dreamless sleep then it's not real" meaning only
that the highest causal Self (god) is real, and that the rest of typical human experience is
transitory.
[b77] Expanding on Gene's comment above, I fully agree that restoring your self-awareness
and retrieving your own identity during the LD is another milestone for humans' mental
development. While I am deeply not convinced about any spiritual claims (religions and
alike) and while I always try to find a 'scientific' reason for their existence, I believe that
there is truly more to this universe than the science can account for or can 'reasonably'
accept as plausible. So, if indeed death is not just The End, then the mere practice of
restating/redefining yourself while in the middle of a LD would pave the way to controlling
your death experiences, when the time comes. ...that is, if you're lucky enough to have

time to prepare yourself... In other words, just as we have so much difficulty escaping those
'serious' nightmares -- simply because we're not aware of their virtuality -- I believe that
whatever godly or ungodly experiences one may have on their final minutes are eventually
conditioned by one's expectations and beliefs (see placebo question below). So, I would say
that practicing LD and also keeping an eye on your own ideas and expectations about the
other world could actually ensure a nice last trip out of here. And well, I would be happy to
know that someone who is afraid of hell, of devils and alike, could eventually become aware
that, whenever and wherever you may be, the one thing that cannot be destroyed in any way
is your being (and staying) aware of yourself, as well as finding a single untouchable spot
of self in the middle of whatever 'happens' around you. As someone who had to learn at
some point to ignore an awful durable physical pain just to avoid losing mind, I eventually
realized that a mental barrier between the self and the rest (including body), as hard to
make and maintain as it is, may be the only apparent solution in such extreme cases. So
yes, do play with LD, play it safe, don't ask too much too fast, and you'll surely be more
than happy about your new invisible power :)
What are the benefits of lucid dreaming (aside from achieving personal
interests)? Are there any negative aspects?
Question asked by Ivlarx24 09:40, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)
R3m0t25: On the forum I frequent, LD4all, there is a large bias towards people who
"just wanna have fun" (eheh) in their dreams. Popular targets include sex, flying, and
shapeshifting.
There are stories in Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming of people who found their
dreams realistic enough to rehearse speeches, or create baking recipes. There were also
stories that simply becoming lucid was an extremely fun experience in itself.
A small amount of people have overcome the fears from their nightmares in their lucid
dreams. The chapter about it in EWLD (the book) is available as a free sample here26
.
Finally, there are people who use lucid dreams as a springboard to reach shared dreams (or
"dreamwalking"), precognitive dreams, out-of-body experiences, and astral projection. I'm
not sure myself why they want those (I imagine out-of-body experiences are fun because
you can see your own body) but apparently some people do. I don't believe in shared and
precognitive dreams myself and I also don't believe that out-of-body experiences and astral
projection really are due to something (spirit, soul?) moving away from your body.
As for negative, I think that the section in ../Introduction27 covers that very well. The only
thing it omits is obsession. ;) r3m0t28 (cont)29 (talk)30 07:34, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

One negative thing is it's harder to be an early riser. You want to sleep more. CannibalSmith31 (talk32) 16:13, 5 January 2008 (UTC)
What is the placebo effect?
The placebo effect33 occurs when something happens just because you believe it will. It
strongly affects the nature of lucid dreams.
I suffered nightmares for many years (a result of abuse as a child), although they declined in
my thirties. In my forties I began to become aware when a dream was beginning to turn
into a nightmare, now 3 things can result from that lucidity: 1. My most satisfactory result
is when I can I alter/divert the next stage of the dream, and it continues without nightmare;
2. I have difficulty diverting the dream sequence but tell myself I must wake up, and do; 3.
I cannot just wake up, but I know I need to ask for help. I make myself speak/moan, which
takes a lot of effort within the dream, but it always wakes my husband, who then wakes me
up.
When I try to use the WILD technique, I feel a stron urge or tiredness to stop
concentrating and go to sleep. Is this normal? It happens early when I first
start.
--118.92.27.19834 (talk35) 12:54, 18 December 2007 (UTC)This has happened to me when I
tried holding my arm up to keep myself awake. Is that what you are doing? Maybe you are
staying too awake, In that case you should relax and let your "awareness" drop, try to find
out how aware you need to be before your awareness drops so far you fall asleep, and aim
just above that level.
Which site would you recommend to go to to discuss lucid dreams and such?
KC36: Take a look at the newsgroup alt.dreams.lucid too. If you're not familiar with the
Usenet, you can reach it via Google Groups37
.
r3m0t38: I'm a frequent poster on LD4all39. Unfortunately, LD4all has a few problems -
the site is sometimes slow, the forum categories are less than perfect and there are plenty of
repeated questions and postings (this is partly why the wikibook exists).

FAQ
Xgamer440: I'd recommend LD4all41. It has many forums to discuss with many other
LD'ers. In fact, this wikibook is mainly the product of the board-goers at LD4all42
.
it's possible to dream inside another dream?, I remember long time ago a
lucid dream where I was in my home, then I tried go to bed to try sleep but
when I tried to do that the dream ended spontaneously...
It is possible to dream that you are dreaming, or to even dream that you have a lucid dream.
The difference between dreaming you are lucid and actually being lucid is the fact that
when not actually lucid, you have no control over the dream. However, I am unsure if it is
possible to have a dream in which you go to sleep and continue a different dream. Dylnuge43
Something like this happened to me. It felt like a normal dream, but i knew that i was
dreaming. I had superpowers and this, but i couldn't control my dream.
I had somehing odd happen to me. Many years ago I awakened as usual one morning.
Everything looked and sounded as it should. My wife was still sleeping. When I looked at
her again, she started shapeshifting, an obvious absurdity in reality. I was speechless and
shocked. Suddenly I realized I was dreaming and greatly relieved. I woke up, got out of
bed, went to the bathroom and something made me realize I was dreaming yet again. This
was in a way more shocking than the first false awakening because it was all so real and I
wondered how far could this regress. At that point I awoke and found myself still in bed.
This time I was not dreaming. A false awakening has never happened since.
i wanted to experience the OBE thing... how am i supposed to do that???
Azmisov: Many of the techniques shown here can be implemented into an OBE/astral travel
experience. OBEs usually involve experiencing vibrational forces going through your body.
(you should check out the Monroe Institute for more info on this) Another method is to just
imagine yourself slipping out of your body. I really don't know if this technique is true OBE,
it may just be another lucid dream. There are a lot of other methods I don't know about,
so you can do some research to find more techniques.

My occurrence for lucid dreaming varies from week to week, is this normal?
For some weeks I can lucid dream everday for a week straight, then all of a
sudden I can't for a month. Lately i have been able to lucid dream twice a
night, sometimes three. Any clue what may cause this? Also when I do lucid
dream alot more, I act normal in a dream. I know I am dreaming, I can fly
around, i can spawn things around me, but I still talk to people as if It was a
real conversation.
<Daydreamer> Whether or not you were lucidly dreaming depends on whether you decided
in your dream to fly, look in the mirror, etc. or whether you were only passively observing
these events taking place in the dream. Realising you are in a dream and then remaining in
the dream is a good sign that it was, as often the realisation you are dreaming is enough of
a shock to wake you up, but the real test is your level of control. As far as not being able to
swallow is concerned, if you were getting sick, especially if you were getting a temperature
or something then this can also affect the vividness of your dreams.
I have good dream recall, and when I sleep I never seem to lucid dream.
When I am dreaming, really weird stuff happens to me. My mind never
questions the bizzare circumstances I am put in. I have tried thinking that "I
will have a lucid dream" over and over, and done some reality checks during
the day. It never occurs to me to do them when I dream. Is there some way
that will make me lucid dream for sure? Am I incapable of Lucid Dreaming?
--Eponymous Anonymous
Li44 - I know what you mean. I've been trying every way to get a lucid dream, but nothing
works. It sucks. I sometimes get really close but freak out and wake up. But despite my
inexperience, I know for sure that everyone is capable of lucid dreaming. Try doing a wider
variety of reality checks maybe, or perhaps try a different technique. What technique are
you using?; WILD and VILD need lots of practice.
Walter Lewin45 11:57, 13 November 2007 (UTC) - Yeah, I tried to do WILD for the past
few weeks. Only once i felt a heavy pain in my chest, I found it hard to move but i could
open my eyes and I woke up soon without dreaming lucid :(
--118.92.27.19846 (talk47) 13:07, 18 December 2007 (UTC) The correct way to do the MILD
method is to go to sleep believing that you will "remember" that you are dreaming. Also,
one key difference between lucid dreamers and non lucid dreamers trying to lucid dream is
that lucid dreamers do not wonder if they are incapable of lucid dreaming, do not think that
it never occors to them to do reality checks when they are dreaming, and tend to treat the
phase "I did not lucid dream last night" as similar to the phase "I did not sleep on the couch
last night", in other words, they tend to see lucid dreaming as something they can choose to
do if they want to, rather than something they want to successfuly achieve at (long) last.

FAQ
Is there a good method to remember your "waking" memories in a dream?
Every time I get a dream I have control over myself, but I do not seem to
know that I am in a dream and I cannot remember anything from when I am
awake(therefore I can't do reality checks or anything "supernatural"). Any
ideas of what I should do?
Is it possible to recall all waking memories in a lucid dream? I have had only
two lucid dreams so far. I know these were lucid, because I did reality checks
with positive results. I even managed to fly, create items, and etc. However, I
couldn't recall a great deal of my waking memories. This cause me to lose
lucidity half way through the dream.

10 Licenses
10.1 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed. Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft
license for software and other kinds of works.
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change the works. By contrast, the
GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions
of a program–to make sure it remains free software
for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation,
use the GNU General Public License for most of our
software; it applies also to any other work released
this way by its authors. You can apply it to your
programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring
to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software
(and charge for them if you wish), that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you
can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these
things.
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others
from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect
the freedom of others.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass
on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show
them these terms so they know their rights.
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your
rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the
software, and (2) offer you this License giving you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify
it.
For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the
GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for
this free software. For both users’ and authors’
sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be
marked as changed, so that their problems will not
be attributed erroneously to authors of previous
versions.
Some devices are designed to deny users access to
install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim
of protecting users’ freedom to change the software.
The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the
area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore,
we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand
ready to extend this provision to those domains in
future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect
the freedom of users.
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by
software patents. States should not allow patents
to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do,
we wish to avoid the special danger that patents
applied to a free program could make it effectively
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program nonfree.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND
CONDITIONS 0. Definitions.
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor
masks.
“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work
licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may
be individuals or organizations.
To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt
all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the
earlier work.
A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.
To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it
that, without permission, would make you directly
or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in
some countries other activities as well.
To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation
that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
Mere interaction with a user through a computer
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate
Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells
the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
the interface presents a list of user commands or
options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the
list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred
form of the work for making modifications to it.
“Object code” means any non-source form of a
work.
A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized
standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one
that is widely used among developers working in
that language.
The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole,
that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of
that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component,
or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source
code form. A “Major Component”, in this context,
means a major essential component (kernel, window
system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a
compiler used to produce the work, or an object
code interpreter used to run it.
The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object
code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run
the object code and to modify the work, including
scripts to control those activities. However, it does
not include the work’s System Libraries, or generalpurpose tools or generally available free programs
which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For
example, Corresponding Source includes interface
definition files associated with source files for the
work, and the source code for shared libraries and
dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate
data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from
other parts of the Corresponding Source.
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code
form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted
for the term of copyright on the Program, and are
irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this
License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges
your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
You may make, run and propagate covered works
that you do not convey, without conditions so long
as your license otherwise remains in force. You may
convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for
you, or provide you with facilities for running those
works, provided that you comply with the terms
of this License in conveying all material for which
you do not control copyright. Those thus making or
running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any
copies of your copyrighted material outside their
relationship with you.
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From AntiCircumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law
fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
When you convey a covered work, you waive any
legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with
respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any
intention to limit operation or modification of the
work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s
users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid
circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License
and any non-permissive terms added in accord with
section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices
of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy
that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified
Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or
the modifications to produce it from the Program,
in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
* a) The work must carry prominent notices stating
that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. *
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating
that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement
modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”. * c) You must license the entire
work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who
comes into possession of a copy. This License will
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This
License gives no permission to license the work in
any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. * d) If
the work has interactive user interfaces, each must
display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the
Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not
make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their
nature extensions of the covered work, and which
are not combined with it such as to form a larger
program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to
limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s
users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not
cause this License to apply to the other parts of the
aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form
under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that
you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one
of these ways:
* a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in,
a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding
Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. * b) Convey the
object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three
years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts
or customer support for that product model, to
give anyone who possesses the object code either
(1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange, for a price no more
than your reasonable cost of physically performing
this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no
charge. * c) Convey individual copies of the object
code with a copy of the written offer to provide
the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. * d) Convey the
object code by offering access from a designated
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent
access to the Corresponding Source in the same way
through the same place at no further charge. You
need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place
to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
directions next to the object code saying where to
find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what
server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long
as needed to satisfy these requirements. * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
provided you inform other peers where the object
code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose
source code is excluded from the Corresponding
Source as a System Library, need not be included
in conveying the object code work.
A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property
which is normally used for personal, family, or
household purposes, or (2) anything designed or
sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or
common use of that class of product, regardless of
the status of the particular user or of the way in
which the particular user actually uses, or expects
or is expected to use, the product. A product is a
consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or nonconsumer uses, unless such uses represent the only
significant mode of use of the product.
“Installation Information” for a User Product
means any methods, procedures, authorization
keys, or other information required to install and
execute modified versions of a covered work in that
User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to
ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered
with solely because modification has been made.
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User
Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a
transaction in which the right of possession and
use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section
must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither
you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to
provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
modified or installed. Access to a network may be
denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or
violates the rules and protocols for communication
across the network.
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation
Information provided, in accord with this section
must be in a format that is publicly documented
(and with an implementation available to the public
in source code form), and must require no special
password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
7. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement
the terms of this License by making exceptions from
one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program
shall be treated as though they were included in
this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply
only to part of the Program, that part may be used
separately under those permissions, but the entire
Program remains governed by this License without
regard to the additional permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may
at your option remove any additional permissions
from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)
You may place additional permissions on material,
added by you to a covered work, for which you have
or can give appropriate copyright permission.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you
may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
material) supplement the terms of this License with
terms:
* a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this
License; or * b) Requiring preservation of specified
reasonable legal notices or author attributions in
that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
displayed by works containing it; or * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
or requiring that modified versions of such material
be marked in reasonable ways as different from the
original version; or * d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of
the material; or * e) Declining to grant rights under
trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or * f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of
section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any
part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a
further restriction, you may remove that term. If a
license document contains a further restriction but
permits relicensing or conveying under this License,
you may add to a covered work material governed
by the terms of that license document, provided
that the further restriction does not survive such
relicensing or conveying.
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with
this section, you must place, in the relevant source
files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to
find the applicable terms.
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive,
may be stated in the form of a separately written
license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work
except as expressly provided under this License.
Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights
under this License (including any patent licenses
granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
However, if you cease all violation of this License,
then your license from a particular copyright holder
is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright
holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright
holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received
notice of violation of this License (for any work)
91
Licenses
from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does
not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.
If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new
licenses for the same material under section 10. 9.
Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely
as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License
grants you permission to propagate or modify any
covered work. These actions infringe copyright if
you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate
your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original
licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
License.
An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all
assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or
merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each
party to that transaction who receives a copy of the
work also receives whatever licenses to the work the
party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from
the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it
or can get it with reasonable efforts.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the
exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this
License. For example, you may not impose a license
fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim
is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
11. Patents.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a
work on which the Program is based. The work
thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.
A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all
patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
contributor version, but do not include claims that
would be infringed only as a consequence of further
modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right
to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent
with the requirements of this License.
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment,
however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such
as an express permission to practice a patent or
covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To
“grant” such a patent license to a party means to
make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying
on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source
of the work is not available for anyone to copy,
free of charge and under the terms of this License,
through a publicly available network server or other
readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
cause the Corresponding Source to be so available,
or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
of the patent license for this particular work, or
(3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but
for the patent license, your conveying the covered
work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more
identifiable patents in that country that you have
reason to believe are valid.
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate
by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,
propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the
covered work, then the patent license you grant is
automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the
exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise
of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under this License. You may not convey a
covered work if you are a party to an arrangement
with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the
third party grants, to any of the parties who would
receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies
of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies
made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with specific products or compilations
that contain the covered work, unless you entered
into that arrangement, or that patent license was
granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No
Surrender of Others’ Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you
from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence
you may not convey it at all. For example, if you
agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you
convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy
both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use
with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any
covered work with a work licensed under version
3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into
a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue
to apply to the part which is the covered work, but
the special requirements of the GNU Affero General
Public License, section 13, concerning interaction
through a network will apply to the combination
as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License
“or any later version” applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either
of that numbered version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide
which future versions of the GNU General Public
License can be used, that proxy’s public statement
of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes
you to choose that version for the Program.
Later license versions may give you additional or
different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later
version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY
OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,
BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall
apply local law that most closely approximates an
absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection
with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption
of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
return for a fee.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to
be of the greatest possible use to the public, the
best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under
these terms.
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of
each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full
notice is found.
<one line to give the program’s name and a brief
idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year>
<name of author>

10.2 GNU Free Documentation License
Version 1.3, 3 November 2008
Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed. 0. PREAMBLE
The purpose of this License is to make a manual,
textbook, or other functional and useful document
"free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially
or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered
responsible for modifications made by others.
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means
that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements
the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
We have designed this License in order to use it
for manuals for free software, because free software
needs free documentation: a free program should
come with manuals providing the same freedoms
that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether
it is published as a printed book. We recommend
this License principally for works whose purpose is
instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND
DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work,
in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder saying it can be distributed under
the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated
herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such
manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the
license if you copy, modify or distribute the work
in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any
work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a
front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook
of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be
a matter of historical connection with the subject
or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of
Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary
then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.
If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text
that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover
Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is
released under this License. A Front-Cover Text
may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text
may be at most 25 words.
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
machine-readable copy, represented in a format
whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for
images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy
made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged
to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
readers is not Transparent. An image format is not
Transparent if used for any substantial amount of
text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
"Opaque".
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent
copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
XML using a publicly available DTD, and standardconforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word
processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD
and/or processing tools are not generally available,
and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or
PDF produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the
title page itself, plus such following pages as are
needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such,
"Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the
beginning of the body of the text.
The "publisher" means any person or entity that
distributes copies of the Document to the public.
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit
of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ
or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ
stands for a specific section name mentioned below,
such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document
means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers
next to the notice which states that this License
applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference
in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty
Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on
the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any
medium, either commercially or noncommercially,
provided that this License, the copyright notices,
and the license notice saying this License applies to
the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that
you add no other conditions whatsoever to those
of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
copies. If you distribute a large enough number of
copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display
copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media
that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you
must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly
and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts
on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly
and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
copies. The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible. You may add other material on the covers
in addition. Copying with changes limited to the
covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones
listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the
Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
each Opaque copy a computer-network location
from which the general network-using public has
access to download using public-standard network
protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in
quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
remain thus accessible at the stated location until
at least one year after the last time you distribute
an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
retailers) of that edition to the public.
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them
a chance to provide you with an updated version of
the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of
the Document under the conditions of sections 2
and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
Modified Version filling the role of the Document,
thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
* A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if
any) a title distinct from that of the Document,
and from those of previous versions (which should,
if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document). You may use the same title as
a previous version if the original publisher of that
version gives permission. * B. List on the Title
92
GNU Lesser General Public License
Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in
the Modified Version, together with at least five of
the principal authors of the Document (all of its
principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless
they release you from this requirement. * C. State
on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher. * D. Preserve
all the copyright notices of the Document. * E. Add
an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. * F.
Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a
license notice giving the public permission to use
the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. *
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in
the Document’s license notice. * H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. * I. Preserve the section
Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it
an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title,
year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
sentence. * J. Preserve the network location, if any,
given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
versions it was based on. These may be placed in
the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four
years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
* K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements"
or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section,
and preserve in the section all the substance and
tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
and/or dedications given therein. * L. Preserve all
the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or
the equivalent are not considered part of the section
titles. * M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the
Modified Version. * N. Do not retitle any existing
section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict
in title with any Invariant Section. * O. Preserve
any Warranty Disclaimers.
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter
sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary
Sections and contain no material copied from the
Document, you may at your option designate some
or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add
their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the
Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must
be distinct from any other section titles.
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements",
provided it contains nothing but endorsements of
your Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text
has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
You may add a passage of up to five words as a
Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words
as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover
Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may
be added by (or through arrangements made by)
any one entity. If the Document already includes
a cover text for the same cover, previously added
by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added
the old one.
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do
not by this License give permission to use their
names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms
defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
provided that you include in the combination all
of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant
Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
The combined work need only contain one copy of
this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there
are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
but different contents, make the title of each such
section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher
of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice
of the combined work.
In the combination, you must combine any sections
Entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".
You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you
follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying
of each of the documents in all other respects.
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH
INDEPENDENT WORKS
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives
with other separate and independent documents or
works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what
the individual works permit. When the Document
is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are
not themselves derivative works of the Document.
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the
Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
on covers that bracket the Document within the
aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers
if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise
they must appear on printed covers that bracket
the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so
you may distribute translations of the Document
under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections
in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this
License, and all the license notices in the Document,
and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you
also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and
disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
translation and the original version of this License
or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
prevail.
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section
1) will typically require changing the actual title.
9. TERMINATION
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
the Document except as expressly provided under
this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, if you cease all violation of this License,
then your license from a particular copyright holder
is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright
holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright
holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received
notice of violation of this License (for any work)
from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does
not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.
If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all
of the same material does not give you any rights
to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that
a particular numbered version of this License "or
any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that specified version or of any later version that
has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify
a version number of this License, you may choose
any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
this License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
11. RELICENSING
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or
"MMC Site") means any World Wide Web server
that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those
works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is
an example of such a server. A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons
Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by
Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in
San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft
versions of that license published by that same
organization.
"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.
An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed
under this License, and if all works that were first
published under this License somewhere other than
this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or
invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated
prior to November 1, 2008.
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an
MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the
same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
To use this License in a document you have written,
include a copy of the License in the document and
put the following copyright and license notices just
after the title page:
Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is
granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no
Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no
Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included
in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation
License".
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts
and Back-Cover Texts, replace the "with . . .
Texts." line with this:
with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and
with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts,
or some other combination of the three, merge
those two alternatives to suit the situation.
If your document contains nontrivial examples of
program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software
license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
10.3 GNU Lesser General Public License
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed.
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3
of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the
“GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.
“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by
this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
An “Application” is any work that makes use of an
interface provided by the Library, but which is not
otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.
A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.
The particular version of the Library with which
the Combined Work was made is also called the
“Linked Version”.
The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for
the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in
isolation, are based on the Application, and not on
the Linked Version.
The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source
code for the Application, including any data and
utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the
System Libraries of the Combined Work. 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3
and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 2. Conveying Modified
Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your
modifications, a facility refers to a function or data
to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of
the modified version:
* a) under this License, provided that you make a
good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part
of its purpose remains meaningful, or * b) under
the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of
the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or
small macros, inline functions and templates (ten
or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the
object code that the Library is used in it and that
the Library and its use are covered by this License.
* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the
GNU GPL and this license document.
4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of
your choice that, taken together, effectively do not
restrict modification of the portions of the Library
contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you
also do each of the following:
* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the
Combined Work that the Library is used in it and
that the Library and its use are covered by this License. * b) Accompany the Combined Work with a
copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. *
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice
for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU
GPL and this license document. * d) Do one of the
following: o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding
Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for,
and under terms that permit, the user to recombine
or relink the Application with a modified version
of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of
the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
o 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for
linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism
is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user’s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified
version of the Library that is interface-compatible
with the Linked Version. * e) Provide Installation
Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6
of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such
information is necessary to install and execute a
modified version of the Combined Work produced
by recombining or relinking the Application with
a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you
use option 4d0, the Installation Information must
accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and
Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
4d1, you must provide the Installation Information
in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU
GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work
based on the Library side by side in a single library
together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License,
and convey such a combined library under terms of
your choice, if you do both of the following:
* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy
of the same work based on the Library, uncombined
with any other library facilities, conveyed under
the terms of this License. * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where
to find the accompanying uncombined form of the
same work.
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General
Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General
Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or
concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that
a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to
it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not
specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of
the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it specifies that a
proxy can decide whether future versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply,
that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of
any version is permanent authorization for you to
choose that version for the Library.
