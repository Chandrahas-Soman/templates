1 Size of cells
1.1 Size of Cells
Figure 1 Cells are so small that even a cluster of these cells from a mouse only
measures 50 microns
Although it is generally the case that biological cells are too small to be seen at all without
a microscope, there are exceptions as well as considerable range in the sizes of various
cell types. Eukaryotic1
cells are typically 10 times the size of prokaryotic2
cells (these cell
types are discussed in the next Chapter). Plant cells are on average some of the largest
cells, probably because in many plant cells the inside is mostly a water filled vacuole. So,
you ask, what are the relative sizes of biological molecules and cells? The following are all
approximations:

related to the development of an understanding of the existence and
importance of cells. The importance of microscopy.
What limits cell sizes?
Prokaryotes - Limited by efficient metabolism
Animal Cells (Eukaryotic) - Limited by Surface Area to Volume ratio
Plant Cells (Eukaryotic) - Have large sizes due to large central vacuole which is responsible
for their growth

2 What is a cell?
Cells are structural units that make up plants and animals; also, there are many single celled
organisms. What all living cells have in common is that they are small 'sacks' composed
mostly of water. The 'sacks' are made from a phospholipid bilayer1 membrane. This
membrane is semi-permeable (allowing some things to pass in or out of the cell while blocking
others). There exist other methods of transport across this membrane that we will get into
later.
So what is in a cell? Cells are 90% fluid (called cytoplasm) which consists of free amino
acids, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and numerous other molecules. The cell environment
(i.e., the contents of the cytoplasm and the nucleus, as well as the way the DNA is packed)
affect gene expression/regulation, and thus are VERY important aspects of inheritance.
Below are approximations of other components (each component will be discussed in more
detail later):
2.0.1 Elements
• 59% Hydrogen (H)
• 24% Oxygen (O)
• 11% Carbon (C)
• 4% Nitrogen (N)
• 2% Others - Phosphorus (P), Sulphur (S), etc.
2.0.2 Molecules
• 50% protein
• 15% nucleic acid
• 15% carbohydrates
• 10% lipids
• 10% Other
2.0.3 Components of cytoplasm
The following is optional reading, as all cell components will be discussed in subsequent
chapters.
• Cytosol - contains mainly water and numerous molecules floating in it- all except the
organelles.
1 Chapter 12 on page 45

What is a cell?
• Organelles (which also have membranes) in 'higher' eukaryote organisms:
• Nucleus (in eukaryotes) - where genetic material (DNA) is located, RNA is transcribed.
• Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) - Important for protein synthesis. It is a transport
network for molecules destined for specific modifications and locations. There are two
types:
• Rough ER - Has ribosomes, and tends to be more in 'sheets'.
• Smooth ER - Does not have ribosomes and tends to be more of a tubular network.
• Ribosomes - half are on the Endoplasmic Reticulum, the other half are 'free' in the
cytosol, this is where the RNA goes for translation into proteins.
• Golgi Apparatus - important for glycosylation, secretion. The Golgi Apparatus is
the "UPS" of the cell. Here, proteins and other molecules are prepared for shipping
outside of the cell.
• Lysosomes - Digestive sacks found only in animal cells; the main point of digestion.
• Peroxisomes - Use oxygen to carry out catabolic reactions, in both plant and animals.
In this organelle, an enzyme called catalase is used to break down hydrogen peroxide
into water and oxygen gas.
• Microtubules - made from tubulin, and make up centrioles,cilia,etc.
• Cytoskeleton - Microtubules, actin and intermediate filaments.
• Mitochondria - convert foods into usable energy. (ATP production) A mitochondrion
does this through aerobic respiration. They have 2 membranes, the inner membranes
shapes differ between different types of cells, but they form projections called cristae.
The mitochondrion is about the size of a bacteria, and it carries its own genetic material
and ribosomes.
• Vacuoles - More commonly associated with plants. Plants commonly have large vacuoles.
• Organelles found in plant cells and not in animal cells:
• Plastids - membrane bound organelles used in storage and food production. These are
similar to entire prokaryotic cells - for example, like mitochondria they contain their
own DNA and self-replicate. They include:
• Chloroplasts - convert light/food into usable energy. (ATP production)
• Leucoplasts - store starch, proteins and lipids.
• Chromoplasts - contain pigments. (E.g. providing colors to flowers)
• Cell Wall - found in prokaryotic and plant cells; provides structural support and
protection.

3 What is the difference between
elements?
The various elements that make up the cell are:
• 59% Hydrogen (H)
• 24% Oxygen (O)
• 11% Carbon (C)
• 4% Nitrogen (N)
• 2% Others - Phosphorus (P), Sulphur (S), etc.
The difference between these elements is their respective atomic weights, electrons, and in
general their chemical properties. A given element can only have so many other atoms
attached. For instance carbon (C) has 4 electrons in its outer shell and thus can only
bind to 4 atoms; Hydrogen only has 1 electron and thus can only bind to one other atom.
An example would be Methane which is CH4. Oxygen only has 2 free electrons, and will
sometimes form a double bond with a single atom, which is an 'ester' in organic chemistry
(and is typically scented).

4 What is living?
The question, "What is life?" has been one of many long discussions and the answer may
depend upon your initial definitions.
Life is cells. Cell theory consists of three basic points.
1. All living things are made of cells.
2. The cell is the smallest living thing that can perform all the functions of life.
3. All cells must come from preexisting cells.
Some definitions of life are:
1. The quality that distinguishes a vital and functional being from a non-living or dead
body or purely chemical matter.
2. The state of a material complex or individual characterized by the capacity to perform
certain functional activities including metabolism, growth, and reproduction.
3. The sequence of physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an
individual.
9
What is living?
4.1 Seven Criteria
Figure 2 A cell undergoing mitosis. Reproduction is one of the seven criteria for life.
In biology, whether life is present is determined based on the following seven criteria:
1. It should maintain some balanced conditions in its inner structure. This is called
Homeostasis
2. Its structure is highly organized.
3. It should be able to break down or build up nutrients to release or store energy based
on need. This is called Metabolism
4. It should grow, which means its structure changes as time goes by in an advantageous
manner.
5. It should show adaptation to the environment.
6. It should be able to respond to environmental stimuli on demand (as opposed to
adaptation, which occurs over time).
7. It should be able to reproduce itself.
10
Seven Criteria
Another way of remembering the seven life processes for children is:-
Movement
Respiration
Sensitivity
Growth
Reproduction
Excretion
Nutrition
Note the beginning letter of all the seven life processes, it spells out MRS GREN.

What is living?
4.2 Virus Controversy
Figure 3 Are these bacteriophages technically alive?
This definition of life has got some problems to it though: As an example, let's take viruses.
Just by your intuition, what would you say: Are viruses alive or dead? Most people's
intuitive answer is: Viruses are alive. When we suffer from any viral infection, we have the
feeling that these viruses that cause or infection are alive. According to the seven principles
as shown above, viruses are dead, as dead as a piece of plastic: They can't reproduce
themselves. To understand that, we want to make a quick excursion to the replication
mechanism of viruses: Viruses are really strange in their reproduction technique. Humans
12
The cell is alive, what about parts of it?
and other animals reproduce by the means of sexual intercourse, bacteria do something
called binary fission: They divide. One cell divides itself into two, the two daughter cells
divide again an so on. The point here is that both bacteria and animals or humans reproduce
actively without any help from outside. Keep this point in mind as we move on two the
viruses. Viruses need other cells to reproduce. They "drill" their way into another cell,
called the host cell. Here, they release the genetic material they carry and, by a complex
mechanism that shouldn't be explained further at this point, force their host cell to produce
exact copies of the virus. After some time, the host cell is full of viruses and bursts, releasing
the new viruses into the environment. Thus viruses need help to reproduce. They can't
reproduce at all without a host cell and therefore do not fulfill the requirement "It should
be able to reproduce itself". Looking at the other parts of the definition we find that viruses
maintain some degree of homeostasis (1), being able to keep its protenatious and nucleic
machinery separated from the outside world. Viruses also show adaptation(5), with their
ability to mutate in order to affect new organisms. In addition to the reproduction problem,
they also fail to meet the other requirements, showing no cellular organization (2) (or indeed
cells at all), metabolism (3), or growth (4).
This example is just to illustrate the problems that arise using this definition. Life is not
something one can define as any other technical term in science. Life arose from dead matter
around 4 billion years ago. When life can arise from dead matter, there can't be a precise
border line between these two.
4.3 The cell is alive, what about parts of it?
Organelles are parts of eukaryotic cells (ones having a nucleus). They help the cell carry
out its task. But, are they alive? Do they meet 7 criteria?
When a cell divides into two, organelles also 'reproduce'. They also age from young to old
and then die. Some of them carry out the task of taking food, converting it to nutrients
and energy. They can also react to stimuli, and surely they can evolve. Of course one can
argue that all the above are coordinated by the nucleus. But it seems there are some signs
of life there.
Yes, there are! Scientists have proven that some bacteria, in its evolutionary way, had
found a home in other cells. They felt comfortable when living there, and gradually, they
have become a part of that cell. Chloroplasts, for example, used to be bacteria. At some
point in their evolutionary history these cyanobacteria formed a mutual symbiosis with the
proto-eukaryote ancestors of algae. Since that time, chloroplasts have been helping plant
cells photosynthesize.
Another example is mitochondria, organelles that produce energy for eukaryotes. Very likely
a parasitic organism originally, the ancestor of the mitochondria we see today colonized
the larger proto-eukarotes. It is unknown if the mitochondrial ancestor originally had a
metabolic role in its life cycle or if it adapted to the changing conditions after it was
engulfed.
13

5 What is interesting about cell biology?
What makes Cell Biology1 particularly interesting is that there is so much that is not fully
understood. A cell is a complex system with thousands of molecular components working
together in a coordinated way to produce the phenomenon we call "life2". During the
20th century these molecular components were identified (for example, see Human Genome
Project3
), but research continues on the details of cellular processes like the control of cell
division4 and cell differentiation5
. Disruption of the normal control of cell division can cause
abnormal cell behavior such as rapid tumor cell6 growth.
Cells have complex interactions with the surrounding environment. Whether it is the external world of a single celled organism or the other cells of a multicellular organism, a
complex web of interactions is present. Study of the mechanisms by which cells respond
appropriately to their environments is a major part of cell biology research and often such
studies involve what is called signal transduction7
. For example, a hormone such as insulin8
interacting with the surface of a cell can result in the altered behavior of hundreds of
molecular components inside the cells. This sort of complex and finely tuned cell response
to an external signal is required for normal metabolism and to prevent metabolic disorders
like Type II diabetes9
.
Most of the cells of a multi-cellular organism have the same genetic material10 in every
cell; yet, there may be hundreds of different types of cells11 that make up the organism's
body each with its own distinctive shape, size, and function. In any case, all of these
cells were developed from one special cell, a zygote12. The study of how the many cell
types develop during embryonic development (Developmental Biology13) is a branch of
Biology that is heavily dependent on the use of microscopy. Much of the control of cell
differentiation is at the level of the control of gene transcription14, the control of which
mRNAs15 are made. Muscle cells make muscle proteins and nerve cells make brain proteins.
Geneticists, molecular biologists and cell biologists are working to discover the details of how

7 Prokaryotes
Figure 4 The structures of two prokaryotic cells. The bacterium (shown at the
top) is a heterotroph, an organism that eats other organisms. Cyanophytes are
autotrophs, organisms that make their food without eating other organisms.
Most of these prokaryotic cells are small, ranging from 1 to 10 microns1 with a diameter
no greater than 1 micron. The major differences between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic
cells are that prokaryotes do not have a nucleus as a distinct organelle and rarely have
any membrane bound organelles [mitochondria, chloroplasts, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi
apparatus, a cytoskeleton of microtubules and microfilaments] (the only exception may be a
bacterium discovered to have vacuoles). Both types contain DNA as genetic material, have
a surrounding cell membrane, have ribosomes[70 s], accomplish similar functions, and are
1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/micron
19
Prokaryotes
very diverse. For instance, there are over 200 types of cells in the human body, that vary
greatly in size, shape, and function.
Prokaryotes are cells without a distinct nucleus.They have genetic material but that material is not enclosed within a membrane. Prokaryotes include bacteria and cyanophytes.
The genetic material is a single circular DNA strand and is located within the cytoplasm.
Recombination happens through transfers of plasmids (short circles of DNA that pass from
one bacterium to another). Prokaryoytes do not engulf solids, nor do they have centrioles
or asters. Prokaryotes have a cell wall made up of peptidoglycin.
In majority of prokaryotes, the genome consists of a circular chromosome whose structure
includes fewer proteins that found in the linear chromosomes of eukaryotes. Their chromosome is located in the nucleoid, a region of cytoplasm that appears lighter than surrounding
cytoplasm in electron micrographs. Also, a single chromosome have much smaller rings of
separately replication DNA called plasmids.
7.1 Cell Surface
Prokaryotic cell walls maintain cell shape, provide physical protection, and prevents the cell
from bursting in a hypotonic environment. In hypertonic environment, most prokaryotes
lose water and shrink away from their wall (plasmolyze). The cell walls of prokaryotes differ
in molecular composition and construction from those of eukaryotes. The bacterial cell walls
contain peptidoglycan, a network of modified-sugar polymers cross linked by short polypeptides. This molecular fabric encloses the entire bacterium and anchors other molecules that
extend from its surface. Archaeal cell walls contain a variety of polysaccharides and proteins
but lack peptidoglycan.
Gram-positive bacteria have simpler walls with a relatively large amount of peptidoglycan. It has a thick cell wall that traps the crystal violet in the cytoplasm. The alcohol rinse
does not remove the crystal violet which masks the added red safanin dye.
Gram-negative bacteria have less peptidoglycan and are structurally more complex, with
an outer membrane that contains lipopolysaccharides. It has a thinner layer of peptidoglycan, and it is located in a layer between the plasma membrane and an outer membrane.
The crystal violet is easily rinsed from the cytoplasm, and the cell appears pink or red.
The cell wall of many prokaryotes is covered by a capsule, a sticky layer of polysaccharide
or protein. The capsule enables prokaryotes to adhere to their substrate or to other individuals in a colony. Some capsules protect against dehydration, and some shield pathogenic
prokaryotes from attack by their host's immune system. Some prokaryotes stick to their
substrate or to one another by means of hair like protein appendages called fimbriae. They
are also known as attachment pili. Fimbriae are usually shorter extension of the plasma
membrane.
In uniform environment, flagellated prokaryotes move randomly, but in heterogeneous environment, many prokaryotes exhibit taxis, movement toward or away from a stimulus. For
example, prokaryotes that exhibit chemotaxis change their movement pattern in response
to chemicals. They move toward nutrients or oxygen (positive chemotaxis) or away from a
toxic substance (negative chemotaxis).
20
Reproduction and Adaptation
7.2 Reproduction and Adaptation
Prokaryotes reproduce quickly in a favorable environment. By binary fission, a single
prokaryotic cell divid into 2 cells, which then divide into 4, 8, 16, and on. Under optimal conditions, many prokaryotes can divide every 1-3 hours. However the cells eventually
exhaust their nutrient supply, poison themselves with metabolic wastes, face competition
from other microorganisms, or are consumed by other organisms. The prokaryotes are
small, they reproduces by binary fission, and they have short generation times. The ability
of some prokaryotes to withstand harsh conditions also contributes to their success. Certain
bacteria develop resistant cell called endospores when an essential nutrient is laking. The
original cell produces a copy of its chromosome and surrounds it with a tough wall, forming
the endospore. Water is removed from the endospore, and its metabolism halt. The rest
of the original ell then disintegrates, leaving the endospore behind. Most endospore are so
durable that they can survive in boiling water. In less hostile environments, endospore can
remain dormant but viable for centuries, able to rehydrate and resume metabolism when
their environment improves.
Due to their short generation times, prokaryotic populations can evolve substantially in
short periods of time. The ability of prokaryotes to adapt rapidly to new conditions highlights the fact that although the structure of their cells is simpler than that of eukaryotic
cells, prokaryotes are not "primitive" or "inferior" in an evolutionary sense. They are
highly evolved, and their population have responded successfully to many different types of
environmental challenges.
Rapid reproduction and mutation In sexually reproducing species, the generation of a
novel allele by a new mutation is rare at any particular gene. Instead, most of the genetic
variation in sexual populations results from the way existing alleles are arranged in new
combinations during meiosis and fertilization. Prokaryotes do not reproduce sexually, so at
first glance their extensive genetic variation may seem puzzling.
After repeated rounds of division, most of the offspring cells are genetically identical to the
original parent cell; however owing to insertions, deletions, and base-pair substitutions in
their DNA, some of the offspring cells may differ genetically. The new mutations, though
individually rare, can greatly increase genetic diversity in specie that has short generation
times and large population sizes. This diversity, in turn, can lead to rapid evolution:
individuals that are genetically better equipped for their local environment tend to survive
and reproduce more prolifically than less fit individuals.
7.3 Transformation and Transduction
In transformation, the genotype and possible phenotype of a prokaryotic cell are altered by
the uptake of foreign DNA from its surroundings. For example, bacteria from a harmless
strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae can be transformed to pneumonia causing cells if they
are placed into a medium containing dead, broken-open cells of the pathogenic strain. This
transformation occurs when a live nonpathogenic cell takes up a piece of DNA carry the
allele for pathogenicity. The foreign allele is then incorporated into the cell's chromosome,
21
Prokaryotes
replacing the existing nonpathogenic allele- an exchange of homologous DNA segments. The
cell is now a recombinant: Its chromosome contains DNA derived from two different cells.
In transduction, bacteriophage carry bacterial genes from one hose cell to another; transduction is a type of horizontal gene transfer. For most phages, transduction results from
accidents that occur during the phage reproductive cycle. A virus that carries bacterial
DNA may not be able to reproduce because it lacks its own genetic material. However,
the virus may be able to attach to another bacterium (a recipient) and inject the piece of
bacterial DNA acquired from the first cell (the donor). Some of this DNA may subsequently
replace the homologous region of the recipient cell's chromosome by DNA recombination.
In such case, the recipient cell's chromosome becomes a combination of NA derived from
two cells; genetic recombination has occurred.
Conjugation and Plasmids In a process called conjugation, genetic material is transferred
between two bacterial cells ( of same or different species) that are temporarily joined. The
DNA transfer is one way: One cell donates the DNA,a nd the other receives ti. The donor
uses sex pili to attach to the recipient. After contacting a recipient cell, each sex pilus
retracts, pulling the two cells together, much like a grappling hook. A temporary "mating
bridge" then forms between the two cells, providing an avenue for DNA transfer. In most
cases, the ability to form sex pili and donate DNA during conjugation results from the
presence of a particular piece of DNA called F factor. The F factor consists about 25 genes,
most required for the production of sex pili. The F factor can exist either as a plasmid or
as a segment of DNA within the bacterial chromosome
The F factor in its plasmid form is called F plasmid. Cells containing the F plasmid,
designated F+ cells, function as DNA donors during conjugation. Cells lacking the F
factor, designated F-, function as DNA recipients during conjugation. The F+ condition is
transferable in the sense that an F+ cell converts and F- cell to F+ is a copy of the entire
F+ plasmid is transferred.
Chromosomal genes can be transferred during conjugation when the donor cell's F factor is
integrated into the chromosome. A cell with the F factor built into its chromosome is called
an Hfr cell. Like an F+ cell, an Hfr cell functions as a donor during conjugation with an Fcell. When chromosomal DNA from an Hfr cell enters and F- cell, homologous regions of
the HFr and F- chromosomes may align, allowing segments of their DNA to be exchanged.
This results in the production of a recombinant bacterium that has genes derived from two
different cells- a new genetic cariant on which evolution can act. Though theses processes
of horizontal gene transfer have so far been studied almost exclusively in bacteria, it is
assumed that they are similarly important in archaea.
7.4 Diverse nutritional and metabolic adaptations
The mechanisms discussed in the previous section- rapid reproduction, mutation, and genetic recombination- underlie that extensive genetic variation found in prokaryotic populations. This variation is reflected in the nutritional adaptations found in prokaryotes. Like
all organisms, prokaryotes can be categorized by their nutrition; how they obtain every and
the carbon used in building the organic molecules that make up cells. Nutritional diversity
is greater among prokaryotes than among eukaryotes: Every type of nutrition observed in
22
The Role of Oxygen In Metabolism
eukaryotes is represented among the prokaryotes, along with some nutritional modes unique
to prokaryotes. Phototrophs are the organisms that obtain energy from light. Chemotrophs
are the organisms that obtain energy from chemicals. Organisms that need only an inorganic compound are called autotrophs. Heterotrophs require at least one organic nutrient
to make other organic compounds. Combining these possibilities for energy sources and
carbon sources results in four major modes of nutrition.
Phtoautotrophs: phtosynthetic organisms that capture light energy and use it to drive
the synthesis of organic compounds other inorganic carbon compounds. Cyanobacteria and
many other groups of prokaryotes are phtoautotrophs, as are plants and algae.
Chemoautotrophs: also need only an inorganic compound; however, instead of using light
as an energy source, they oxidize inorganic substance, such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia,
or ferrous ions. This mode of nutrition is unique to certain prokaryotes.
Photoheterotrophs: Harness energy from light but must obtain carbon in organic form.
This mode is unique to certain marine and halophilic (salt-loving) prokaryotes.
Chemoheterotrphs: must consume organic molecules to obtain both energy and carbon.
This nutritional mode is widespread among prokaryotes. Dungi, animals, most protists,
and even some parasitic plants are also chemoheterotrophs.
7.5 The Role of Oxygen In Metabolism
Prokaryotic metabolism also varies with respect to oxygen. Obligate aerobes use oxygen
for cellular respiration and cannnot grow without it. Obligate anaerobes, however, are
posioned by oxygen. Some obligate anaerobes live exclusively by fermentation; other extract
chemical energy by anaerobic respiration, in whcih substance other than oxygen such as
nitrate ions or sulfate ions accept electrons at the "downhill" end of electron transport
chains. Facultative anaerobes use oxygen if it is present but can also carry out anaerobic
respiration or fermentation in an anaerobic environment.
Nitrogen Metabolism Nitrogen is essential for the production of amino acids and nucleic
acids in all organisms. Whereas eukaryotes can obtain nitrogen from only a limited group
of nitrogen compounds, prokaryotes can metabolize nitrogen in a wide variety of forms.
For example, some cyanobacteria and some methanogens covert atmospheric nitrogen to
ammonia, a process called nitrogen fixation. The cells can then incorporate this "fixed"
nitrogen into amino acids and other organic molecules. In terms of their nutrition, nitrogenfixing cyanobacteria are some of the most self-sufficient organisms, since they need only light,
carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water and some minerals to grow. Nitrogen fixation by prokaryotes
has a large impact on other organisms. For example, nitrogen -fixing prokaryotes can
increase the nitrogen but can use the nitrogen compounds that the prokaryotes produce
from ammonia.
Metabolic Cooperation Cooperation between prokaryotes allows them to use environmental resource they could not use as individual cells. In some cases, this cooperation takes
place between specialized cells of a colony. For instance, the cyanobacterium Anabaena
has genes than encode proteins for photosynthesis and for nitrogen fixation, but a single
cell cannot carry out both processes at the same time. The reason is that photosynthesis
23
Prokaryotes
produces oxygen which inactivates the enzymes involved in nitrogen fixation. Instead of living as isolated cells, anabaena forms filamentous colonies synthesis while a few specialized
cells called heterocytes carry out only nitrogen fixation. Each heterocyte is surrounded by
a thickened cell wall that restricts entry of oxygen produced by neighboring photosynthetic
cells. Intercellular connections allow heterocytes to transport fixed nitrogen to neighboring
cells and to receive carbohydrates.
Metabolic cooperation between different prokaryotic species often occurs in surface-coating
colonies known as biofilms. Cells in a biofilm secrete signaling molecules that recruit nearby
cells, causing the colonies to grow. The cells also produce proteins that stick the cells to
the substrate and on to another. Channels in the biofilm allow nutrients to reach cells in
the interior and wastes to be expelled. Biofilm damage industrial and medical equipment,
contaminate products, and contribute to tooth decay and more serious health problems.
In another example of cooperation between prokaryotes, sulfate-consuming bacteria coexist
with methane-consuming archaea in ball- shaped aggregates on the ocean floor. The bacteria
appear to use the archaea's waste products, such as organic compounds and hydrogen. In
turn, the bacteria produce compounds that facilitate methane consumption by the archaea.
This partnership has global ramifications.

8 Bacteria
Bacteria are prokaryotic, unicellular organisms. Bacteria are very small; so much so that 1
billion could fit on 1 square centimeter of space on the human gums, and 1 gram of digested
food has 10 billion bacteria. Bacteria are the simplest living organisms. Previously they fell
under the Kingdom Moneran, but now they fall into two different Domains: Archaebacteria
and Eubacteria. There are several differences between the two. Typically, microbiologists
in the 21st century call these groups "Archaea" and "Bacteria." One of the co-discoverers
of the three Domains has argued that the term "prokaryote" should be removed from
classrooms because it reflects an evolutionary hypothesis that has been disproved, given
that the Archaea are more closely related to the Eukarya than they are to the Bacteria
(Pace 2006, Nature 441 p. 289).
It is incorrect to think of bacteria as particularly "simplistic" for all that they do not have
internal organelles that can be visualized using a light microscope. The bacterial nucleoid,
for example, is a highly organized structure even though it typically contains just one or two
circular chromosomes with a total of millions of basepairs of DNA (Thanbichier et el., 2005,
J Cell. Biochem. 96:506-521; see also http://www.microbelibrary.org/Laboratory%
20Diagnostics/details.asp?id=782&Lang=English). Bacteria have complex cell walls
exterior to the cell membrane. Some bacteria contain plasmids, which are typically circular
DNA with replication that is uncoupled from binary fission (cellular division). Plasmids
in nature often encode traits of significant interest to humans, such as the ability to be
resistant to clinically important antibiotics, or the ability to degrade "odd" carbon sources
such as TNT or human-made pollutants. Plasmids fromEscherichia coli have been "domesticated" and have long been in use for genetic engineering, as it is easier to isolate
and modify plasmid DNA, and introduce it into a new cells, than it is to modify a bacterial chromosome (see "Techniques" at dnai.org; see also http://www.microbelibrary.
org/Laboratory%20Diagnostics/details.asp?id=707&Lang=English). A few phylogenetic groups of bacteria can make endospores, which are metabolically inert but are able
to resist high temperatures, radiation, and desiccation (see http://www.microbelibrary.
org/Laboratory%20Diagnostics/details.asp?id=2511&Lang=English).
Bacterial reproduction is always asexual and usually occurs through binary fusion, once
thought to be a simple process of growing and dividing. Microbiologists now know, however,
that binary fission is complex in that it requires dozens of proteins cooperating to build the
septum (new cell wall between 'daughter' cells) and to actively separate the two daughter
chromosomes. Furthermore, there are other forms of reproduction in bacteria, all of them
"asexual" in that they do not use gametes or involve genetic exchange (Angert 2005, Nature
Reviews Microbiology 3:214-224). Genetic exchange in bacteria is instead called horizontal
(or lateral) gene transfer, because bacteria can obtain genetic information from organisms
that are not their parents (Amabile-Cuevas 2003, American Scientist 91:138-149). (Vertical
genetic transmission is the inheritance of DNA down through the generations.) Horizontal
gene transfer can happen any time and has nothing to do with cell division. There are
25
Bacteria
three main types, conjugation which is the sharing of plasmid DNA; transduction, where
a bacterial virus accidentally transfers bacterial DNA from one bacterium to another, and
transformation, where bacteria bind to DNA in the environment, internalize it, and can use
that DNA as genetic material.
8.1 Archaea
Archaea are microbes that are more closely related to Eukaryotic cells than they are to the
Bacteria (http://tolweb.org/tree/home.pages/aboutoverview.html). Under a light
microscope, they visually resemble Bacteria, so that it wasn't until the advent of the use
of molecular methods in evolutionary biology that they were recognized as belonging to
their own Domain (a phylogenetic grouping above the level of Kingdom). Archaea have
ultrastructural features that are superficially similar to those in Bacteria but are usually
comprised of distinctive molecules. They do, for example, have a cell wall, yet that cell
wall never contains peptidoglycan. Instead, peptidoglycan is a unique molecular signature
of the Bacteria. Archaea also have odd lipids in their cell membranes. They were originally
discovered living in extreme environments thought to resemble conditions on early earth,
but now that microbiologists have become more adept at detecting them, it is clear that the
Archaea are not confined to extreme habitats and can instead be found everywhere. It is
true that some Archaea are "extremophiles," found in extremely salty or hot environments,
but there are also extremophile Bacteria and even some very unusual extremophile Eukarya.
The best-understood groups of Archaea are:
1. Methanogens use Carbon dioxide and Hydrogen to make Methane. They are found in
sewage, cows, and swamps, and they do not take in oxygen.
2. Extreme Halophiles live in extremely salty places (i.e.: the dead sea and great salt
lake).
3. Thermoacidophiles prefer extremely hot, acidic areas (i.e.: hot springs and volcanos).
8.2 Bacteria
(sometimes called "eubacteria")
Bacteria have peptidoglycan in their cell walls, and they have no unusual phospholipids.
Bacteria have four shapes:
• bacilli (rod shaped)
• vibrios (curved shaped)
• coccus (round shaped)
• spirilli (spiral shaped).
Bacteria can also have prefixes before their names: strepto, indicating chains of the shaped
bacteria, and staphylo, indicating clusters of the shaped bacteria. A 19th century microbiologist invented the Gram stain, still used today to differentiate bacteria into two types, Gram
negative and Gram positive (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Gram).
These types are not useful in determining phylogeny but can be very useful in a clinical
26
Bacteria
setting, because Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria can exhibit differential sensitivity to some classes of antibiotics. There are probably dozens of "Kingdoms" within the
Domain Bacteria, but the phylogeny of Bacteria is still disputed as microbiologists continue
to study the evolution of bacteria using molecular methods. Some of the major types of
Bacteria are:
1. Cyanobacteria are photoautotrophs that strip electrons from water and use them to
fix carbon dioxide; they are a major source of organic carbon in marine ecosystems.
2. Spirochetes are Gram negative bacteria that have flexible cells and internal flagella in
an unusual form of a more typical Gram negative cell wall.
3. Proteobacteria (E-coli)
Some bacteria produce virulence factors that can cause sickness. Some examples of these
are serotoxins, which are given off by the Gram positive bacteria, and endotoxins, which are
given off by Gram negative bacteria as they die. There are many other examples, however,
and specific pathogens make a unique suite of virulence factors that lead to the particular
disease caused by that pathogen.

9 Eukaryotes
Figure 5 An animal Cell
Eukaryotes house a distinct nucleus, a structure in which the genetic material (DNA) is
contained, surrounded by a membrane much like the outer cell membrane. Eucaryotic cells
are found in most algae, protozoa, all multicellular organisms (plants and animals) including
humans. The genetic material in the nucleus forms multiple chromosomes that are linear
and complexed with proteins that help the DNA 'pack' and are involved in regulation of
gene expression.
The cells of higher plants differ from animal cells in that they have large vacuoles, a cell wall,
chloroplasts, and a lack of lysosomes, centrioles, pseudopods, and flagella or cilia. Animal
29
Eukaryotes
cells do not have the chloroplasts, and may or may not have cilia, pseudopods or flagella,
depending on the type of cell.
9.1 Comparing Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells
All cells have several basic features in common: they are all bounded by a selective barrier,
plasma membrane. Cytosol is a jellylike substance that is semifluid. All cells contain
chromosomes which carry genes in the form of DNA, and ribosomes that make proteins
according to instructions from the gene. The major difference between prokaryotic and
eukaryotic cels is the location of their DNA. In eukaryotic cell, DNA is found at the nucleus,
which is bounded by a double membrane. (the word eukaryotic is from the Greek eu, true,
and karyon, kernel, here referring to the nucleus).
Eukaryotic cells are much larger than prokaryotic cells; size is general aspect of cell structure
that relates to function. The logistics of carrying out cellular metabolism sets limits on cell
size. At the lower limit, the smallest cells, known are bacteria called mycoplasmas have
diameters between 0.1 and 1.0mm. These are the smallest packages with enough DNA to
program metabolism and enough enzymes and other cellular equipment to carry out the
activities necessary for a cell to sustain itself and reproduce.
Metabolic requirements also impose theoretical upper limits on the size that is practical for
a singel cell. Plasma membrane functions as a selective barrier that allows sufficient passage
of oxygen, nutrients, and wastes to service the entire cell. For each square micrometer of
membrane, only a limited amount of a particular substance can cross per second, so the
ratio of surface area to volume is critical. As a cell increases in size, its volume grows
proportionately more than its surface area. Area is proportional to a linear dimension
squared, whereas volume is proportional to the linear dimension cubed. Therefore a smaller
object has a greater ration of surface area to volume.
The need for a surface area sufficiently large to accommodate the volume helps explain
the microscopic size of most cells, and the narrow, elongated shapes of others, such as
nerve cells. Larger organisms has more cells compare to smaller cells. High ratio of surface
area to volume is especially important in cells that exchange a lot of material with their
surroundings such as intestinal cells. Such cells may have many long, thin projections from
their surface called microvilli, which increase surface area without an appreciable increase
in volume.

In plant cell, chloroplasts, central vacuole, cell wall, and plasmodesmata are present but
not in animal cells.
9.4 Nucleus
The nucleus contains most of the genes in the eukaryotic cell; some genes are located in
mitochondria and chloroplast. It is generally the most conspicuous organelle in a eukaryotic
cell. The nuclear envelope encloses the nucleus, sparating its contents from the cytoplasm.
The nuclear envelope is a double membrane, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins.
The envelope is perforated by pore structure that are about 100nm in diameter. At the
lip of each pore, the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are continuous.
Pore complex lines each pore and regulates the entry and exit of most proteins and RNAs,
as well as large complexes of macromolecules. Except at the pores, the nuclear side of the
envelope is lined by the nuclear lamina, a netlike array of protein filaments that maintains
the shape of the nucleus by mechanically supporting the nuclear envelope. Also nuclear
matrix, a framework of fibers extending throughout the nuclear interior, present.
Chromosomes are organized DNA units that carry the genetic information. Each chromosome is made up of material called chromatin, a complex of proteins and DNA. Stained
chromatic usually appears as a diffuse mass, byt as a cell prepares to divide, the thin chromatin fibers coil up and condense thick enough to be distinguished as chromosomes. Each
eukaryotic species has a characteristic number of chromosomes. For example human has 46
chromosomes.
Nucleolus is a prominent structure within the nondividing nucleus. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
is synthesized from instructions in the DNA; in nucleolus, proteins imported from the cytoplasm are assembled with rRNA into large and small ribosomal subunits. Theses subunits
then exit the nucleus through the nuclear pores to the cytoplasm, where a large and a small
subunit can assemble into a ribosome. the number depends on the species and the stage in
the cell's reproductive cycle.
32
Ribosomes
The Nucleus directs protein synthesis by synthesizing messenger RNA (mRNA) according
to instructions provided by the DNA. The mRNA is then transported to the cytoplasm via
the nuclear pores. Once an mRNA molecule reaches the cytoplasm, ribosomes translate the
mRNA's genetic message into the primary structure of a specific poly peptide.
9.5 Ribosomes
Ribosomes are complexes made of ribosomal RNA and protein; ribosomes are the cellular
components that carry out proteins synthesis, also known as protein factories. Cells that
have high rates of protein synthesis have particularly large number of ribosomes. Cells
active in protein synthesis also have prominent nucleoli. Ribosomes build proteins in two
cytoplasmic locales. Free ribosomes are suspended int he cytosol, while bound ribosomes
are attached to the outside of the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear envelope. Bound and
free ribosomes are structurally identical, and ribosomes can alternate between the two roles.
Most of proteins are made on free ribosomes function within the cytosol. Bound ribosomes
generally make proteins that are destined for insertion into membranes, for packaging within
certain organelles such as lysosomes, or for export from the cell (secretion).
9.6 The Endomembrane System
Endomembrane system carries out a variety of tasks in the cell. These tasks include synthesis of proteins and their transport into membranes and organelles or out of the cell,
metabolism and movement of lipids, and detoxification of poisons. The membrane of this
system are related either through direct physical continuity or by the transfer of membrane
segments as tiny vesicles. The various membranes are not identical in structure and function; the thickness, molecular composition, and types of chemical reactions carried out in a
given membrane are not fixed but modified several times during the membrane's life. The
endomembrane system includes the nuclear envelope, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi
apparatus, lysosomes, various kinds of vacuoles, and the plasma membrane.
9.7 Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an extensive network of membrane that it accounts for
more than half the total membrane in many eukaryotic cells. The word endoplasmic means
"within the cytoplasm", and reticulum is Latine for "little net". The ER consists of a
network of membranous tubules and sacs called cisternae. The ER membrane separates the
internal compartment of the ER, ER lumen (cavity) or cisternal space, from the cytosol.
Since ER membrane is continuous with the nuclear envelope, the space between the two
membranes of the envelope is continuous with the lumen of the ER. Smooth ER lacks
ribosomes on its outer surface, and Rough ER has ribosomes on the outer surface of the
membrane. Ribosomes are also attached to the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope's
outer membrane.
33
Eukaryotes
Smooth ER- The smooth ER functions in diverse metabolic processes, which vary with
cell type. Theses processes include synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, and
detoxification of drugs and poisons. Enzymes of the smooth ER are important in the
synthesis of lipids, including oils, phospholipids, and steroids. Sex hormones of vertebrates
and the various steroid hormones are produced by the smooth ER in animal cells. Other
enzymes of the smooth ER help detoxify drugs and poisons in liver cells. Detoxification
involves adding hydroxyl groups to drug molecules, making them more soluble and easier
to flush from the body. For example, sedative phenobarbital and other barbiturates are
the drugs that metabolized in this manner by smooth ER in liver cells. Barbiturates,
alcohol, and many other drugs induce the proliferation of smooth ER and its associated
detoxification enzymes, therefore, increasing tolerance to the drugs; in other words, higher
doses are required to achieve a particular effect. Also, because some of the detoxification
enzymes have relatively broad action, the proliferation of smooth ER in response to one
drug can increase tolerance to other drugs as well. The smooth ER also stores calcium ions;
in muscle cells, a specialized smooth ER membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol
into the ER lumen. When a muscle cell is stimulated by a nerve impulse, calcium ions rush
back across the ER membrane into the cytosol and trigger contraction of the muscle cell.
Rough ER- Many times of cells secrete proteins produced by ribosomes attached to rough
ER. As a polypeptide chain grows from a bound ribosomes, it is threaded into the ER lumen
through a pore formed by a protein complex in the ER membrane. As the new protein enters
the ER lumen, it folds into its native shape. Most secretory proteins are glycoproteins, which
have carbohydrates covalently bonded to them. After secretory proteins are formed, the ER
membrane keeps them separate from proteins that are produced by free ribosomes and will
remain in the cytosol. Secretory proteins depart from the ER wrapped in the membranes
of vesicles that bud like bubbles from a specialized region called transitional ER. Transport
vesicles are the vesicles in transit from one part of the cell to another. Rough ER is
also a membrane factory for the cell; it grows in place by adding membrane proteins and
phospholipids to its own membrane. As polypeptide destined to be membrane proteins grow
from the ribosomes, they are inserted into the ER membrane and are anchored there by
their hydrophobic portions. The rough ER makes its own membrane phospholipids; enzymes
build into the ER membrane assemble phospholipids from precursors in the cytosol. The ER
membrane expands and is transferred in the form of transport vesicles to other components
of the endomembrane system.
9.8 Golgi Apparatus
Golgi is a center of manufacturing, warehousing, sorting, and shipping. The products of the
ER are modified and stored and then sent to other destinations. Golgi apparatus is extensive
in cells specialized for secretion. The Golgi apparatus consists of flattened membranous sac,
cisternae. The membrane of each cisterna in a stack separates ints internal space from the
cytosol. Besicles concentrated in the vicinity of the Golgi apparatus are engaged in the
transfer of material between parts of the Golgi and other structures. Golgi stack has a
distinct structural polarity with the membrane of cisternae on opposite side of the stack
different in thickness and molecular composition. The two poles of a Golgi stack are referred
to as the cis face and the trans face; cis is the receiving and trans is shipping departments
of the Golgi apparatus. The cis face is usually located near ER. Transport vesicles move
34
Lysosomes
material from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. A vesicle that buds from the ER can add its
membrane and the contents of its lumen to the cis face by fusing with a Golgi membrane.
The trans face give rise to vesicles, which pinch off and travel to other sites. The products
of ER are usually modified during their transit from the cis region to the trans region
of the Golgi. Various Golgi enzymes modify the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins;
carbohydrates are first added to proteins int he rough ER during the process of polypeptide
synthesis. The carbohydrate on the resulting glycoprotein is then modified as it passes
through the rest of the ER and the Golgi. The Golgi removes some sugar monomers
and substitutes other, producing a large variety of carbohydrates. In addition, the Golgi
apparatus manufactures certain macromolecules by itself. Many polysaccharides secreted by
cells are Golgi products, including pectins and certain other non-cellulose polysaccharides
made by plant cells and incorporated along with cellulose into their cell walls. Similar to
secretory proteins, non-protein Golgi products will be secreted depart from the trans face
of the Golgi inside transport vesicles that eventually fuse with the plasma membrane.
The Golgi manufactures and refines its products in stages, with different cisternae containing
unique teams of enzymes. Recent research has give rise to a new model of the Golgi as a
more dynamic structure; According to the cisternal maturation model, the cisternae of
the Golgi actually progress forward from the cis to the tras face of the Golgi, carrying and
modifying their cargo as they move. Before a Golgi stack dispatches its products by budding
vesicles fromt he trans face, it sorts these products and targets them for various parts of the
cell. Molecular identification tags, such as phosphate groups added to the Golgi products,
aid in sorting. Transport vesicles budded fromt he Golgi may have external molecules on
their membranes that recognize "docking site" on the surface of specific organelles or on
the plasma membrane, therefore, targeting the vesicle appropriately.
9.9 Lysosomes
Lysosome is a membranous sac of hydrolytic enzymes that an animal cell uses to digest
macromolecules. Lysosomal enzymes work best in the acidic environment found in lysosomes. If a lysosome breaks open or leaks its contents, the released enzymes are not very
active because the cytosol has a neutral pH. However, excessive leakage from a large number of lysosomes can destroy a cell by autodigestion. Hydrolytic enzymes and lysosomal
membrane are made by rough ER and then transferred to the Golgi apparatus for further
processing. Proteins of the inner surface of the lysosomal membrane and the digestive
enzymes are spared from destruction by having three dimensional shapes that protect vulnerable bonds from enzymatic attack.
Phagocytosis is a process that amoebas and many other protists eat by engulfing smaller
organisms or other food particles. The food vacuole formed , and then fuses with a lysosome
and digests the food. Digestion products pass into cytosol and become nutrients for the
cell. In human body, white blood cell helps defend the body by engulfing and destroying
bacteria and other invaders.
Lysosome use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's own organic material; this is
called autophagy. During autophagy, damaged organelle or small amount of cytosol become
surrounded by a double membranes, and lysosome fuses with the outer membrane of their
vesicle. The lysosomal enzymes dismantle the enclosed material, and the organic monomers
35
Eukaryotes
are returned to the cyotosol for reuse. The lysosomes become engorged with indigestible
substrates, which begin to interfere with other cellular activities.
9.10 Vacuoles
Vacuoles are membrane-bounded vesicles whose functions vary in different kinds of cells.
Food vacuoles are formed by phagocytosis. Many freshwater protists have contractile vacuoles that pump excess water out of the cell, thereby maintaining a suitable concentration
of ions and molecules inside the cell. In plants and fungi, which lacks lysosomes, vacuoles
carry out hydrolysis;
The central vacuole develops by the coalescence of smaller vacuoles, themselves derived
from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The vacuolar membrane is selective
in transportin solutes. As result, the solution inside the central vacuole is called cell sap,
is different in composition from the cytosol. It can hold reserves of important organic
compounds such as proteins stockpiled in the vacuoles of storage cells in seeds. Also it is
the plant cell's main repository of inorganic ions, such as potassium and chloride. Many
plant cells use their vacuoles contain pigments that color the cells. Vacuoles may also
help protect the plant against predators by containing compounds that are poisonous or
unpalatable to animals. The vacuole has a major role in the growth of plant cells, which
enlarge as their vacuoles absorb water, enabling the cell to become larger with a minimal
investment in new cytoplasm.
9.11 Mitochondria and Chloroplasts
Mitochondria and chloroplasts are the organelles that convert energy to forms that cells
can use for work. Mitochondria are the site of cellular respiration, the metabolic process
that generates ATP by extracting energy from sugars, fats, and other fuels with the help of
oxygen. Chloroplasts, are found in plants and algae, and they are the sites of photosynthesis.
They convert solar energy to chemical energy by absorbing sunlight and using it to drive the
synthesis of organic compounds such as sugar from carbon dioxide and water. Both of them
are not part of endomembrane system. Mitochondria have two membrane separating their
innermost space from the cytosol, and chloroplasts have three. The membrane proteins of
mitochondria and chloroplasts are made not by ribosomes bound to the ER, but by free
ribosomes in the cyotosol and by ribosomes contained within these organelles themselves.
They also contain small amount of DNA that programs the synthesis of the proteins made
on the organelle's ribosomes. Mitochondria and chloroplasts are semiautonomous organelles
that grow and reproduce within the cell.
Mitochondria Mitochondria are found in all eukaryotic cells; Some cells have a singel
large mitochondrion, but more often a cell has hundreds or thousands of mitochondria. The
number correlates with he cell's level of metabolic activity. The mitochondrion is enclosed by
two membranes, each a phospholipid bilayer witha unique collection of embedded proteins.
The outer membrane is smooth, but the inner membrane is convoluted, with infolding called
cristae. The inner membrane divides the mitochondrion into two internal compartments.
The first is the inter-membrane space, the narrow region between the inner and outer
36
Cytoskeleton
membranes. The second compartment, the mitochondrial matrix, is enclosed by the inner
membrane. the matrix contains many different enzymes as wellas the mitochondrial DNA
and ribosomes. Enzymes in the matrix catalyze some steps of cellular respiration. Other
proteins that function in respiration, including the enzyme that makes ATP are built into
the inner membrane, As highly folded surface, the cristae give the inner mitochondrial
membrane a large surface ares, thus enhancing the productivity of cellular respiration.
Chloroplasts The chloroplast is a specialized member of related plant organelles called
plastids. Chloroplasts contain the green pigment chlorophyll, along with enzymes and
other molecules that function in the photosynthetic production of sugar. Its shape is lensshaped and found in leaves. The contents of a chloroplast are partitioned from the cytosol
by an envelope consisting of two membranes separated by a very narrow intermembrane
space. Inside the chloroplast is another membranous system in the form of flattened, intern=connected sacs called thylakoids. Thylakoids are stacked like poker ships, and each
stack is called granum. The fluid outside the thylakoids is the stroma which contains the
chloroplast DNA and ribosomes as well as many enzymes. The membranes of the chloroplast divide the chloroplast space into three compartments: the intermembrane space, the
stroma, and the thylakoid space.
9.12 Cytoskeleton
Cytoskeleton is a network of fibers extending throughout the cytoplasm. It plays a major
role in organizing the structure and activities of the cell. It is composed of three types of
molecular structure: microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. The main
function of the cytoskeleton is to give mechanical support to the cell and maintain its shape.
Cytoskeleton is stabilized by balance between opposing forces exerted by its elements. The
cytoskeleton is more dynamic than an animal skeleton; it can be quickly dismantled in one
part of the cell and reassembled in a new location, changing the shape of the cell. Also
several types of cell motility involve the cytoskeleton. the cell motility encompasses both
changes in cell location and more limited movements of parts of the cell. Cell motility require
the interaction of the cytoskeleton with motor proteins. Cytoskeletal elements and motor
proteins work together with plasma membrane molecules to allow whole cells to move along
fibers outside the cell. The cytoskeleton is also involved in regulating biochemical activities
in the cell in response to mechanical stimulation forces exerted by extracellular molecules
via cell-surface proteins are apparently transmitted into the cell by cytoskeletal elements,
and the forces may even reach the nucleus.
Microtubules- thickest
All eukaryotic cells have microtubules; the wall of the hollow tube is constructed from a
globular protein called tubulin. Each tubulin protein is a dimer, a molecule made up of
two subunits. A tubulin dimer consists of two slightly different polypeptides, alpha-tublin,
and beta-tubulin. Microtubules grow in length by adding tubulin dimers. Due to the
architecture of a microtubules, its two ends are slightly different; one end can accumulate
or release tubulin dimers at a much higher rate than the other, therefore, growing and
shrinking significantly during cellular activities. This is called the "plus end", not because
it can only add tubulin proteins but because it's the end where both "on" and "off" rates
37
Eukaryotes
are much higher. Microtubules shape and support the cell and also serve as tracks along
which organelles equipped with other proteins can move.
In animal cells, microtubules grow out from a centrosomes, a region that is often located
near the nucleus and considered a "microtubule-organizing center". Theses microtubules
function as compression-resisting girders of the cytoskeleton. Within the centrosome are
a pair of centrioles, each composed of nine sets of triplet microtubules arrange in a ring.
Before division, the centrioles replicate; although centrosomes with centrioles may help
organize microtubule assembly in animal cell,s they are not essential for this function in all
eukaryotes.
Also specialized arrangement of microtubules is responsible for the beating of flagella and
cilia. Thees are microtubule containing extensions that project from some cells. When
cilia or flagella extend from cells that are held in place as part of a tissue layer, they
can move fluid over the surface of the tissue. Flagella and cilia different in their beating
patterns. A flagellum has an undulating motion that generates force in the same direction
as the flagellum's axis. However cilia work more like oars, with alternating power and
recovery strokes generating force in a direction perpendicular to the cilium's axis. A cillium
may also act as a signal-receiving "antenna" for the cell. Cilia that have this function are
nonmotile, and there is only one per cell. Membrane proteins on this kind of cilium transmit
molecular signals from the cell's movement to its interior, triggering signaling pathways that
may lead to changes int he cell's activities. Cillia-based signaling appears to be crucial to
brain function and to embryonic development. Motile cilia and flagella share a common
ultrastructure; each has a core of microtubules sheathed in an extension of the plasma
membrane. Nine doublets of microtubules, the members of each parit sharing part of their
walls, are arranged in a ring. This arrangement, referred to as the "9+2" pattern, is found
in all eukaryotic flagella and motile cilia. Non-motile primary cilia have "9+0" pattern,
lacking the central pari of microtubules. The microtubule assembly of a cilium or flagellum
is anchored in the cell by a basal body, which is structurally very similar to a centriole.
In flagella and motile cilia, flexible cross-linking proteins, evenly spaced along the length
of the cilium or falgellum, connect the outer doublets to each other and to the two central
microtubules Each outer doublet also has paris of protruding proteins spaced along its length
and reaching toward the neighboring doublet; These are large motor proteins called dyneins,
composed of several polypeptides. Dyneins are responsible for the bending movements of
the organelle. A dynein molecule performs a complex cycle of movements cause by changes
in these shape of the proteins, with ATP providing the energy for these changes. The
mechanics of dynein-based bending involve a process that resembles walking. A typical
dynein protein has two "feet" that "walk" along the microtubule of the adjacent doublet, one
foot maintaining contact while the other releases and reattaches one step further along the
microtubules. Without any restraints ont he movement of the microtubules doublets, one
doublet would continue to "walk" along and slide past the surface of the other, elongating
the cilium or flagellum rather than bending it.
Microfillaments- thinnest
Microfilaments are solid rods about 7nm in diameter. They are also called as actin filaments
because they are build from molecules of actin, a globular protein. A microfilament si a
twisted double chain of actin subunits. Microfilaments can form structural networks, due to
the presence of proteins that bind along the side of an actin filament and allow a new filament
38
Cell Wall
to extend as a branch. The structure role of microfilaments in the cytoskeleton is to bear
tension. A cortical microfilaments, a three-dimensional network formed by microfilaments
just inside the plasma membrane, helps support the cell's shape. This network give the
outer cytoplasmic layer of a cell called the cortex.
In animal cells specialized for transporting materials across the plasma membrane, such as
intestinal cells, bundles of microfilaments make up the core of microvilli. Microfillaments are
well known for their role in cell motility, particularly as part of the contractile apparatus
of muscle cells (myosin). Localized contraction brought about by actin and myosin also
plays a role in amoeboid movement, which a cell such as an amoeba crawls along a surface
by extending and flowing into cellular extension called pseudopodia. pseudopodia extend
and contract through the reversible assembly of actin subunits nto microfilaments and of
microfillaments into networks that convert cytoplasm fro a sol to a gel. The pseudopodium
extends until the actin reassembles into a network.
In plant cells, both actin-myosin interactions and sol-gel transformations brought about by
actin may be involved in cytoplasmic streaming, a circular flow of cytoplasm within cells.
intermediate filaments- middle range intermediate filaments are larger than the diameter
of microfilaments but smaller than that of microtubules. Specialized for bearing tension
(like microfilaments), intermediate filaments are a diverse class of cytoskeletal elements.
Each type is constructed from a different molecular subunit such as keratins. Intermediate
filaments are more permanent fixture of cells than are microfilaments and microtubules.
Even after the death of the cell, intermediate filament networks often persist. Intermediate
filaments are important in reinforcing the shape of a cell and fixing the position of certain
organelles. For instance, the nucleus commonly sits within a cage made of intermediate
filaments, fixed in location by braches of the filaments that extend into the cytoplasm.
Other intermediate filaments make p the nuclear lamina that lines the interior of the nuclear
envelope. In case where the shape of the entire cell is correlated with function, intermediate
filaments support that shape.
9.13 Cell Wall
Cell wall is an extracellular structure of plant cell that distinguishes them from animal
cells. The wall protects the plant cell, maintains its shape, and prevents excessive uptake
of water. The strong walls of specialized cells hold the plant up against the force of gravity.
Plant cell walls are musch thicker than the plasma membrane, and the exact chemical
composition of the wall varies from species to species and even from one cell type to another
in the same plante, but basic design of the wall is consistent. Microfibrils made of the
polysaccharide cellulose are synthesized by an enzyme called cellulose synthase and secreted
to the extracellular space, where they become embedded in a matrix of other polysaccharides
and proteins. This combination of materials, strong fibers in a "ground substance" (matrix),
is the same basic architectural design found in steel-reinforced concrete and in fiberglass.
A young plant cell first secrets a thins and flexible wall called the primary cell wall; as the
cell grows, the cellulose fibrils are oriented at right angels to the direction of cell expansion,
possibly affecting the growth pattern. Between primary walls of adjacent cell is the middle
lamella, which is a thin layer rich in sticky polysaccharides pectins. The middle lamella flues
39
Eukaryotes
adjacent cells together. When the cell mature and stops growing, it strengthens its wall.
Some plant cells do this simply by secreting hardening substances into the primary wall,
but other cells add a secondary cell wall between the plasma membrane and the primary
wall. Then secondary wall, often deposited in several laminated layer, has a strong and
durable matrix that afford the cell protection and support.

10 Unique Properties of Plant Cells

<< Eukaryotes3
| Unique Properties of Plant Cells
Plant Cells have a number of important differences compared to their animal counterparts.
The major ones are the Chloroplasts, Cell walls and Vacuoles. Unlike animal cells, plant
cells do not have centrioles.
10.1 Chloroplasts
The chloroplasts are an organelle similar to the mitochondria in that they are self reproducing and they are the energy factories of the cell.they are near the large center vacuole.
There most of the similarities ends. Chloroplasts capture light energy from the sun and
convert it into ATP and sugar. In this way the cell can support itself without food.
10.2 Vacuoles
Plants often have large structures containing water surrounded by a membrane in the center
of their cells. These are vacuoles and act as a store of water and food (in seeds), a place
to dump wastes and a structural support for the cell to maintain turgor. When the plant
loses water the vacuoles quickly lose their water, and when plants have a lot of water the
vacuoles fill up. In mature plants there is usually one large vacuole in the centre of the cell.
10.3 Cell walls
Plant cells are not flaccid like animal cells and have a rigid cell wall around them made of
fibrils of cellulose embedded in a matrix of several other kinds of polymers such as pectin and
lignin. The cellulose molecules are linear and provide the perfect shape for intermolecular
hydrogen bonding to produce long, stiff fibrils. It is the cell wall that is primarily responsible
for ensuring the cell does not burst in hypotonic surroundings.

11 Parts of the cell

12 Membranes
../Parts of the cell/1 The cell membrane is very important, because it works as a selective
filter that allows only certain things to come inside or go outside the cell, it act as a body
guard for our body.It can maintain a stable and healthy environment for cell in order to
keep people healthy.
plant cell membranes are rigid walls, and animal cell membranes are lipid bilayers.

45
Membranes
The phospholipid bilayer which the cell membrane is an example of, is composed of various
cholesterol, phospholipids2
, glycolipids, blagoscony and proteins. Below is an example of a
simple phospholipid bilayer3
.
Figure 7
The smaller molecules shown between the phospholipids4 are Cholesterol5 molecules. They
help to provide rigidity or stability to the membrane. The two main components of phospholipids6 are shown in these figures by blue circles representing the hydrophilic head groups
and by long thin lines representing the hydrophobic fatty acid tails.
Both the interior of the cell and the area surrounding the cell is made up of water or similar
aqueous solution. Consequently, phospholipids orient themselves with respect to the water
and with each other so that the hydrophilic ("water loving") head groups are grouped
together and face the water, and the hydrophobic ("water fearing") tails turn away from
the water and toward each other. This self-organization of phospholipids7
results in one of
just a few easily recognizable structures. Cell membranes are constructed of a phospholipid
bilayer8 as shown above.
Smaller structures can also form, known as 'micelles' in which there is no inner layer of
phospholipid. Instead, the interior of a micell is wholly hydrophobic, filled with the fatty acid
chains of the phospholipids and any other hydrophobic molecule they enclose. Micelles are
not so important for the understanding of cellular structure, but are useful for demonstrating
the principles of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, and for contrasting with lipid bilayers.
At least 10 different types of lipids are commonly found in cell membranes. Each type of
cell or organelle will have a different percentage of each lipid, protein and carbohydrate.
The main types of lipids are:
• Cholesterol
• Glycolipids

The Cell Membrane is Asymmetric
• Phosphatidylcholine
• Sphingomyelin
• Phosphatidylethnolamine
• Phosphatydilinositol
• Phosphatidylserine
• Phosphatidylglycerol
• Diphosphatidylglycerol (Cardiolipin)
• Phosphatidic acid
12.1 The Cell Membrane is Asymmetric
The cell membrane tends to have different composition on one side of the membrane than
on the other side of the membrane. The differences can be caused by the different ratios or
types of amphipathic lipid-based molecules, the different positioning of the proteins (facing
in or facing out), or the fixed orientations of proteins spanning the membrane. Additionally,
there are different enzymatic activities in the outer and inner membrane surfaces.
The reason the cell membrane is asymmetric is because when the proteins are synthesized by
the preexisting membranes, they are inserted into the membrane in an asymmetric manner.
The asymmetry of the cell membrane allows the membrane to be rigid and allows the cell
to have a different intracellular environment from the existing extracellular environment.
Additionally, the cell membrane's phospholipids are distributed asymmetrically across the
lipid bilayer, in a phenomenon called membrane phospholipid asymmetry. There are three
mechanisms for transmembrane movement of phospholipids: 1) spontaneous diffusion, 2)
facilitated diffusion, 3) ATP-dependent active translocation.
The spontaneous diffusion is a form of passive transport. Because passive transport does
not require energy to transport non-polar substances through the membrane, this can happen spontaneously. Facilitated diffusion, like spontaneous diffusion, is a form of passive
transport. The molecules or ions in this diffusion pass through the membrane by using
specific transmembrane transport proteins.
Membrane transport of small molecules Because animal membrane proteins are lipid
bilayer which are inner hydrophobic, this character prohibits polar molecules. Transport
proteins can provide help for this situation. It can transport polar molecules across the
membrane. There are several types of membrane transport proteins. They are uniports
and cotransport. Uniports can move solutes from one side to another, change the position
of the proteins. Cotransport systems can simultaneously sending two solutes across the lipid
bilayer. Solutes are sent in the same direction or opposite directions Transport proteins does
not need to be acts natural direction.
Membrane Transport of Macromolecules Membrane transport of Macromolecules can
divide into two parts, they are exocytosis and endocytosis. In exocytosis, the contents of
vesicles are released when the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane. There are five steps
involved, which are vesicle trafficking, vesicke tethering, vesicle docking, vesicle priming
and vesicle fusion. In endocytosis the membrane depresses and pinches off, enclosing the
molecule. In receptor-mediated endocytosis, coated pits and vesicles bind to specific re47

ceptors on the cell surface, allowing the cell to select what molecules to take and what to
reject.

13.1 Nucleus
The nucleus contains genetic material or DNA in the form of chromatin, or, during mitosis
or late interphase, chromosomes. All transcription and replication of genetic material takes
place within the nucleus, as does mRNA processing. The nucleolus also resides within
the nucleus, and is responsible for rRNA transcription and folding. Translation of mRNA
transcripts takes place outside of the nucleus.

Organelles
13.2 Mitochondria
A mitochondrian is the organelle responsible for a cell's metabolism. It synthetizes ATP
through a protein called ATP synthase. Mitochondria have a double membrane. An outer
membrane and a folded inner membrane. The internal membrane, called the cristae is
invaginated (folded or creased), to maximize surface area enabling it to hold more ATP
synthases.
13.3 Ribosomes
Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis. They are comprised of interacting protein
and nucleic acid chains. Broadly, ribosomes are comprised of a large and a small subunit.
The small subunit functions to attach to the mRNA strand and hold it in place during
translation, while the large subunit holds and manufactures the growing polypeptide chain.
The large subunit is further subdivided into the A (aminoacyl), P (peptidyl), and E (exit)
binding sites.
Aminoacyl Binding Site The aminoacyl binding site binds a charged tRNA whose anticodon matches the codon in the A site.
Peptidyl Binding Site The peptidyl binding site contains the molecular machinery that
transfers the bound polypeptide from the tRNA to the polypeptide chain, and holds the
growing chain in place.
Exit Site The exit site is the terminal binding site for tRNA, where discharged tRNA's
are released from the translation complex.
13.4 Endoplasmic Reticulum
The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) acts as a transport from the nucleus and ribosomes to
the Golgi apparatus. There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum:
13.4.1 Smooth ER
Smooth ER act as transport for various things, mainly the RNA from the nucleus to the
ribosomes (RNA is a small piece of the DNA code specifically designed to tell the ribosomes
what to make). Smooth ER appears smooth in texture, hence the name. Smooth ER plays
an important role in lipid emulsification and digestion in the cell.
13.4.2 Rough ER
Rough ER are "rough" because of the ribosomes embedded in them. The rough ER take
the protein to the Golgi apparatus to be packaged into vacuoles
50
Golgi Complex
13.5 Golgi Complex
The Golgi Complex basically functions as a "packaging center" for the cell, attaching "address labels" (functional groups) to various cell products to direct them to their respective
locations, and "packaging" the products into vacuoles to ensure delivery. Anatomically,
the Golgi Complex consists of layers of lipid membrane stacked one one top of another,
with a cis face and a trans face. As the molecular product being packaged moves through
the complex, various enzymes act upon it to induce vacuole formation and functional group
attachment.
13.6 Vacuole
Figure 9 Paramecium, with contractile vacuoles indicated using arrows.
51
Organelles
Vacuoles are cellular storage places. Like the cell membrane, they are comprised of a lipid
bilayer that functions as a selectively permeable barrier to regulate movement of materials
into and out of the compartment. They can serve a variety of purposes, storing food,
water, or waste products, or immune functions such as containing dangerous materials or
maintaining turgor pressure (in plants). Vacuoles serve very different purposes in plant cells
than they do in animal cells.
Plant Cells In plants, vacuoles comprise a significant portion of the cell's total volume and
often contribute significantly to the function of a differentiated cell. For example, vacuoles
in stomata cells contain large numbers of potassium ions, which can be pumped in or out
to open or close the stomata.
Animal Cells In animal cells, vacuoles serve more subordinate roles, such as assisting in
endo- and exocytosis or basic storage of food and waste.
Central Vacuole The central vacuole is found only in plant cells. It is filled with water
and is pressurised, like a balloon. This forces all the other organelles within the cell out
toward the cell wall. This pressure is called turgor pressure and is what gives plants their
"crisp" and firm structure.
13.7 Peroxisomes
Peroxisomes perform a variety of metabolic processes and as a by-product, produce hydrogen
peroxide. Peroxisomes use peroxase enzyme to break down this hydrogen peroxide into water
and oxygen.
13.8 Lysosomes
Lysosomes are vacuoles containing digestive and destructive membranes. In white blood
cells, these are used to kill the bacteria or virus, while in tadpole-tail cells they kill the cell
by separating the tail from the main body.
They also do much of the cellular digestion involved in apoptosis2
, the process of programmed cell death.

16 Cell division
57

17 Cell cycle
The normal cell cycle consists of 2 major stages. The first is interphase, during which the
cell lives and grows larger. The second is Mitotic Phase. Interphase is composed of three
subphases. G1 phase (first gap), S phase (synthesis), and G2 phase (second gap). The
interphase is the growth of the cell. The normal cell functions of creating proteins and
organelles. The Mitotic Phase is composed of Mitosis and Cytokinesis. Mitosis1
, when the
cell divides. Mitosis can be further divided into multiple phases. Cytokinesis, which is when
the two daughter cells complete their separation. Mitosis is the division of the nucleus and
cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm. There is some overlap between there two sub
phases. Reproductive cell division is called meiosis, which yields a nonidentical daughter
cells that have only one set of chromosomes. In other words, they have half as many
chromosomes as the parent cell. Meiosis occurs in gonads, ovaries or testes. Therefore
combining two gametes together produce 46 chromosomes.
17.1 From Wikipedia
The cell cycle is the cycle of a biological cell, starting from the time it is first formed from
a dividing parent cell until its own division into two cells, consisting of repeated mitotic cell
division and interphase (the growth phase). A cell spends the overwhelming majority of its
time in the interphase(about 90% of time).
17.2 Background Information
Genome is a cell's endowment of DNA, which is its genetic information. Prokaryotic genome
is often a single long DNA molecule, and Eukaryotic genomes consist of number of DNA
molecules. A typical human cell has about 2m of DNA, which is 250,000 times greater than
the cell's diameter. Before the cell division, all of the DNA must be copied and then two
copies gets separated so that each daughter cell ends up with a complete genome. Chromosomes are the packaged DNA molecules. Because of chromosomes, the replication and
distribution of so much DNA is manageable. Every eukaryotic species has a characteristic
number of chromosomes in each cell nucleus. They contain two sets of each chromosome:
one set inherited from each parent. For example human somatic cells (all body cells except
the reproductive cells) each contain 46 chromosomes; the reproductive cells, gametes, have
half as many chromosomes as somatic cells. The number of chromosomes in somatic cells
varies widely among species. Eukaryotic chromosomes are made of chromatin that is a
complex of DNA and associated protein molecules. Each single chromosome contains one
1 Chapter 19 on page 69
59
Cell cycle
very long, linear DNA molecule that carries several hundred to a few thousand genes; the
associated proteins maintain the structure of the chromosome and help control the gene
activity. When a cell is not dividing, each chromosome is a long thins chromatic fiber;
however after DNA duplication chromosomes condense. Each chromatin fiber coils and
folds. Each duplicated chromosome has two sister chromatids, containing an identical DNA
molecule, initially attached along adhesive protein complex; such attachment is called sister chromatid cohesion. In condensed form of chromosome, a center narrow part is called
centromere, a specialized region where the two chromatids are closely attached. The other
part of a chromatid on either side of the centromere is referred as arm. Once the sister
chromatids separate, they are considered individual chromosomes.
17.3 Overview
Figure 10 Schematic of the cell cycle. I=Interphase, M=Mitosis. The duration of
mitosis in relation to the other phases has been exaggerated in this diagram.
60
Mitosis
Mitotic phase includes both mitosis and cytokinesis which is usually the shortest part of
the cell cycle. Interphase accounts about 90%of the cycle; during interphase the cell grows
and copies its chromosomes in preparation for cell division. Interphase is divided into sub
phases: G1 phase ("first gap"), the S phase ("synthesis"), and G2 phase ("second gap").
The chromosomes are duplicated only during the S phase. During G1 phase cell grows until
S phase where the cell prepares for the cell division during G2 phase. Based from human
cell, M phase only takes about 1 hour while the S phase occupy about 10-12 hours.
The cell cycle consists of
• G1 phase, the first growth phase
• S phase, during which the DNA is replicated, where S stands for the Synthesis of DNA.
• G2 phase is the second growth phase, also the preparation phase for the
• M phase or mitosis2 and cytokinesis3
, the actual division4 of the cell into two daughter
cells
The cell cycle stops at several checkpoints and can only proceed if certain conditions are
met, for example, if the cell has reached a certain diameter. Some cells, such as neurons,
never divide once they become locked in a G0 phase.
17.4 Mitosis
Mitosis has five stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Mitotic spindle starts to form in the cytoplasm during prophase. it is made of microtubules and
other associated proteins. while the mitotic spindle assembles, the microtubules of the cytoskeleton disassemble, providing the material used to construct the spindle. In animal cells,
the assembly of spindle microtubules starts at the centrosome, the microtubule-organizing
center. In plant cells, the centrioles are not present. During interphase in animal cells, the
single centrosome replicates; the two centrosomes remain together near the nucleus and they
move apart during prophase and prometaphase of mitosis as spindle microtubules grows.
The two centrosomes are located at the opposite end of the cell. Then aster, a radial array
of short microtubules, extends from each centrosome. Kinetochore is a structure of proteins
associated with specific sections of chromosomal DNA at the centromere. Each of the two
sister chromatids of a replicated chromosome contains kinetochore as it face in opposite
direction. During prometaphase, kinetochore microtubules form as come of the spindle microtubules attach to the kinetochores. After the microtubuels are attached to chromosome's
kinetochores, the chromosome begins to move towards the pole from which those microtubules extend. the chromosomes moves in a motion like a tug-of-war. Metaphase plate is
the imaginary plane that formed during metaphase the centromeres of all the duplicated
chromosomes are on the plane midway between the spindle's two poles. The other microtubules that did not attach to kinetochores overlap and interact with other nonkinetochore
microtubules from the opposite pole. The nonkinetochore microtubules are responsible for
elongating the whole cell during anaphase. During anaphase, the cohesins holding the sister
chromatids of each chromosome are cleaved by enzymes. Then the chromatids separated,

61
Cell cycle
and they move towards the opposite ends of the cell. The region of overlap is reduced as
motor proteins attached to the microtubules move away from one another, using ATP. As
the microtubules push apart from each other, their spindle poles are pushed apart, elongating the cell. As the duplicate groups of chromosomes arrive at the opposite ends of the
elongated parent cell, the telophase begins; during telophase nuclei reforms and cytokinesis
begins.
• G2 of Interphase:During G2 phase, a nuclear envelope bounds the nucleus, and two
centrosomes forms by replication of a single centrosome. In animal cells, each centrosome
contains two centrioles. The chromosomes are duplicated during S phase but cannot be
seen since they are not condensed yet.
• Prophase: the chromatin fibers coils and dense into chromosomes and the nucleoli disappear. Each duplicated chromosome has tow identical sister chromatids joined at their
centromeres along with their arms by cohesins, then the mitotic spindle form. The asters
are the radial arrays of shorter microtubules that extend from the centrosomes. Propelled
by the lengthening microtubules, the centrosomes move away from each other.
• Prometaphase: As the nuclear envelope fragments, the microtubules extending from
each centrosome invade the nuclear area. the chromosome become more condensed as
each of the two chromatids of each chromosome has a kinetochore. Some of the microtubules attach to the kinetochores ("kinetochore microtubules" and other nonkinetochore
microtubules interact with each from fromt he opposite pole of the spindle.
• Metaphase: Metaphse is the longest stage of mitosis. The centrosomes are placed at the
opposite poles of the cell. The chromosomes' centromeres lie ont he metaphse plate as the
chromosome convene on the metaphase plate. Each kinetochores of the sister chromatids
are attacged to kinetochore microtubules coming from opposite poles.
• Anaphase: Anaphase is the shortest stage of mitosis, and begins whent he cohesin
proteins are cleaved, allowing the two sister chromatids of each pair to part suddenly.
The two liberated daughter chromosomes moves towards oppostie ends of the cell as
the kinetochore microtubules shorten. The cell starts to elongate and nonkinetochore
microtubules lengthen. By the end of anaphase, the two ends of the cell have equivalent
collections of chromosome.
• Telophse: Two daughter nuclei form in the cell, and nuclear envelopes arise fromt he
fragments of the parent cell's nuclear envelope. As nucleoli reappear, the chromosome
become less condensed, and completes the division of the one nucleus into two genetically
identical nuclei.
• Cytokinesis: In animal cells, cytokinesis involves formation of cleavage furrow; in plante
cell the cleavage furrow does not exist. The formation of cell wall in the middle of cell
(cell plate) divides the cell into two daughter cells.
62
Details of mitosis
17.5 Details of mitosis
Figure 11 Schematic of interphase (brown) and mitosis (yellow).
17.6 Cytokinesis
The cytokinesis process begins with cleavage. Cleavage furrow, a shallow groove in the cell
surface near the old metaphase plate, is the first sign of cleavage. As it process, contractile
ring of actin microfilaments form on the cytoplasmic side. The actin microfilaments interact
with the myosin molecules, and cause the ring to contract. As the cleavage furrow deepens,
the cell is separated into two with its own nucleus. For plant cells, there is no cleavage furrow
because they have the cell walls. Instead of forming cleavages, vesicles derived from the
Golgi apparatus move along microtubules to the middle of the cells, and forms cell plate. As
the cell plate enlarges, and surrounding membrane fuses with the plasma membrane along
the perimeter of the cell and from two daughter cells.
17.7 Binary Fission
Binary fission is a method of asexual reproduction by "division in half". In prokaryotes,
binary fission does not involve mitosis, but in single celled eukaryotes that undergo binary
fission. In bacteria, motst genes are carried on a single bacterial chromosome that consists
of a circular DNA molecule and associated proteins. The chromosome of the bacterium
Escherichia coli, is 500 times as long as the cell when it is sctreched out. At the origin
of replication, DNA of the bacterial chromosome begins to replicate. As the chromosome
continues to replicate, one origin moves rapidly toward the opposite end of the cell, and the
cell elongates. When the replication is complete the bacterium is about twice its initial size,
and its plasma membrane grows inward, dividing the parent E. coli cell into two daughter
cells. Bacteria don’t have mitotic spindles; the two origins of replication end up at opposite
ends of the cell or in some other very specific location.
63
Cell cycle
17.8 The Evolution of Mitosis
Since the prokaryotes were on Earth more than a billion years than eukaryotes that mitosis
had its origins in simpler prokaryotic mechanism of the cell reproduction can be assumed.
Some of the proteins involved in bacterial binary fission are related to eukaryotic proteins
that function in mitosis. Possible hypothesis of evolution of mitosis is that prokaryotic cell's
reproduction gave rise to mitosis.
17.9 The Cell Cycle Control System
Based from mammalian cell grow experiment, possible hypothesis was supported: the cell
cycle is driven by specific signaling molecules present in the cytoplasm. In this experiment
two cells in different phase of the cell cycle were fused to form a single cell with two nuclei.
One cell was in the S phase and the other was in G1, and G1 nucleus immediately entered
the S phase, as though stimulated by chemicals present in the cytoplasm of the first cell.
Therefore, if a cell undergoing mitosis (M phase) was fused with another cell in any stage
of its cell cycle, the second nucleus enteres mitosis. Other experiments on animal cells
and yeasts demonstrates the sequential events of the cell cycle control system; the cell
cycle control system operates set of molecules in the cell that both triggers and coordinates
key events in the cell cycles. The cell cycle control system proceeds on its own, but it is
regulated at certain checkpoints by internal and external signals. Animal cells have built-in
stop signals that halt the cell cycle at checkpoints until they get go-ahead signals. The
signals report whether crucial cellular processes that should have occurred by that point
have in fact been completed correctly and thus whether or not the cell cycle should proceed.
The three check points are in G1, G2, and M phase. For mammalian cells, G1 check points
are the most important. When a cell receives a go-ahead signal at the G1 checkpoint, the
cell complete the G1, S, G2 and M phases and divide; however when a cell does not get
a go-ahead signal, it will exit the cycle and enter non dividing state, G0 phase. Most of
human cells are in G0 phase, such as mature nerve cells and muscle cells. However the liver
cells can re-enter the cycle by external signals such as growth factor released during injury.
Rhythmic fluctuations in the abundance and activity of cell cycle control molecules pase
the sequential events of the cell cycle. The regulatory molecules are portins of two types:
protein kinases and cyclins. Portin kinases are enzymes that activate or inactivate other
proteins by phosphorylating. The protein kinases give the go-ahead signals at the G1 and G2
checkpoints. The kinases that drive the cell cycle are present at a constant concentration in
the growing cell, but they are in an inactive form. In order to activate them, kinase must be
attached to a cyclin, a protein that cyclically fluctuating concentration in the cell. Because
of such requirement, these are called cyclin-dependent kinases or Cdks. The activity of
cdks rises and falls with changes in the concentration of its cyclin partner. The cylclin
level rises during the S and G2 phases and then falls rapidly during M phase. MPF, the
maturation -promoting factor, or M-phase -promoting factor, activity corresponds to the
peaks of cyclin concentration. MPF triggers the cell's passage past the G2 checkpoint into M
phase. MPF acts both directly as a kinase and indirectly by activating other kinases. During
anaphase, MPF hels switch itself off by initiating a process that leads to the destruction
of its own cyclin. The Cdk, noncyclin part of MPF, persists in the cell in inactive form
until it associates with new cyclin molecules synthesized during the S and G2 phase of the

next round of the cycle. Density-dependent inhibition is a phenomenon in which crowded
cells stop dividing. It is caused by external physical factor. Also most animal cells exhibit
anchorage dependence; in order to divide, the cells must be attached to a substratum; like
a cell density, anchorage is signaled to the cell cycle control system via pathways involving
plasma membrane proteins and elements of cytoskeleton linked to them. The loss of cell
cycle controls leads to cancer cells, which exhibit neither density-dependent inhibition nor
anchorage dependence.

18 Meiosis
Meiosis is a special type of cell division that is designed to produce gametes. Before meiosis
occurs, the cell will be double diploid and have a pair of each chromosome, the same as
before mitosis.
Meiosis consists of 2 cell divisions, and results in four cells. The first division is when genetic
crossover occurs and the traits on the chromosomes are shuffled. The cell will perform a
normal prophase, then enter metaphase during which it begins the crossover, then proceed
normally through anaphase and telophase.
The first division produces two normal diploid cells, however the process is not complete.
The cell will prepare for another division and enter a second prophase. During the second
metaphase, the chromosome pairs are separated so that each new cell will get half the
normal genes. The cell division will continue thorough anaphase and telophase, and the
nuclei will reassemble. The result of the divisions will be 4 haploid gamete cells.
18.1 Crossover
Crossover is the process by which two chromosomes paired up during prophase I of meiosis
exchange a distal portion of their DNA. Crossover occurs when two chromosomes, normally
two homologous instances of the same chromosome, break and connect to each other's
ends. If they break at the same locus, this merely results in an exchange of genes. This
is the normal way in which crossover occurs. If they break at different loci, the result
is a duplication of genes on one chromosome and a deletion on the other. If they break
on opposite sides of the centromere, this results in one chromosome being lost during cell
division.
Any pair of homologous chromosomes may be expected to cross over three or four times
during meiosis. This aids evolution by increasing independent assortment, and reducing the
genetic linkage between genes on the same chromosome.

19 Mitosis
Mitosis is the normal type of cell division. Before the cells can divide, the chromosomes
will have duplicated and the cell will have twice the normal set of genes.
The first step of cell division is prophase, during which the nucleus dissolves and the
chromosomes begin migration to the midline of the cell. (Some biology textbooks insert a
phase called "prometaphase" at this point.)The second step, known as metaphase, occurs
when all the chromosomes are aligned in pairs along the midline of the cell. As the cell
enters anaphase, the chromatids, which form the chromosomes, will separate and drift
toward opposite poles of the cell. As the separated chromatids, now termed chromosomes,
reach the poles, the cell will enter telophase and nuclei will start to reform. The process
of mitosis ends after the nuclei have reformed and the cell membrane begins to separate the
cell into two daughter cells, during cytokinesis.
Figure 12 Mitosis divides genetic information during cell division.
The mitotic phase which includes both mitosis and cytokinesis is the shortest part of the
cell cycle. The interphase cycle accounts for about 90% of the cell cycle. This phase is
where the cell grows and copies its chromosomes in preparation for cell division. In the G1
phase which is also called the “first gap” the cell grows as it copies its chromosomes. In S
phase, the cell starts to synthesize the DNA and completes preparation for cell division. In
G2 it starts to divide.
In biology, Mitosis is the process of chromosome segregation and nuclear division that
follows replication of the genetic material in eukaryotic cells. This process assures that
each daughter nucleus receives a complete copy of the organism's genetic material. In most
eukaryotes, mitosis is accompanied with cell division or cytokinesis, but there are many
exceptions, for instance among fungi. There is another process called meiosis, in which the
daughter nuclei receive half the chromosomes of the parent, which is involved in gamete
formation and other similar processes, which makes the parent cell still active.
69
Mitosis
Mitosis is divided into several stages, with the remainder of the cell's growth cycle considered
interphase. Properly speaking, a typical cell cycle involves a series of stages: G1, the
first growth phase; S, where the genetic material is duplicated; G2, the second growth
phase; and M, where the nucleus divides through mitosis. Mitosis is divided into prophase,
prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase.
The whole procedure is very similar among most eukaryotes, with only minor variations.
As prokaryotes lack a nucleus and only have a single chromosome with no centromere, they
cannot be properly said to undergo mitosis.
19.1 Prophase
Figure 13
The genetic material (DNA), which normally exists in the form of chromatin condenses into
a highly ordered structure called a chromosome. Since the genetic material has been duplicated, there are two identical copies of each chromosome in the cell. Identical chromosomes
(called sister chromosomes) are attached to each other at a DNA element present on every
chromosome called the centromere. When chromosomes are paired up and attached, each
individual chromosome in the pair is called a chromatid, while the whole unit (confusingly)
is called a chromosome. Just to be even more confusing, when the chromatids separate, they
are no longer called chromatids, but are called chromosomes again. The task of mitosis is
to assure that one copy of each sister chromatid - and only one copy - goes to each daughter
cell after cell division.
The other important piece of hardware in mitosis is the centriole, which serves as a sort
of anchor. During prophase, the two centrioles - which replicate independently of mitosis
- begin recruiting microtubules (which may be thought of as cellular ropes or poles) and
forming a mitotic spindle between them. By increasing the length of the spindle (growing
the microtubules), the centrioles push apart to opposite ends of the cell nucleus. It should be
noted that many eukaryotes, for instance plants, lack centrioles although the basic process
is still similar.
70
Prometaphase
19.2 Prometaphase
Figure 14
Some biology texts do not include this phase, considering it a part of prophase. In this
phase, the nuclear membrane dissolves in some eukaryotes, reforming later once mitosis is
complete. This is called open mitosis, found in most multicellular forms. Many protists
undergo closed mitosis, in which the nuclear membrane persists throughout.
Now kinetochores begin to form at the centromeres. This is a complex structure that may
be thought of as an 'eyelet' for the microtubule 'rope' - it is the attaching point by which
chromosomes may be secured. The kinetochore is an enormously complex structure that
is not yet fully understood. Two kinetochores form on each chromosome - one for each
chromatid.
When the spindle grows to sufficient length, the microtubules begin searching for kinetochores to attach to.
19.3 Metaphase
Figure 15
As microtubules find and attach to kinetochores, they begin to line up in the middle of
the cell. Proper segragation requires that every kinetochore be attached to a microtubule
before separation begins. It is thought that unattached kinetochores control this process
by generating a signal - the mitotic spindle checkpoint - that tells the cell to wait before
proceeding to anaphase. There are many theories as to how this is accomplished, some
of them involving the generation of tension when both microtubules are attached to the
kinetochore.
When chromosomes are bivalently attached - when both kinetochores are attached to microtubules emanating from each centriole - they line up in the middle of the spindle, forming
71
Mitosis
what is called the metaphase plate. This does not occur in every organism - in some cases
chromosomes move back and forth between the centrioles randomly, only roughly lining up
along the midline.
19.4 Anaphase
Figure 16
Anaphase is the stage of meiosis or mitosis when chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles of the cell (opposite ends of the nuclear spindle). Centromeres are broken and
chromatids rip apart.
When every kinetochore is attached to a microtubule and the chromosomes have lined
up along the middle of the spindle, the cell proceeds to anaphase. This is divided into two
phases. First, the proteins that bind the sister chromatids together are cloven, allowing them
to separate. They are pulled apart by the microtubules, towards the respective centrioles
to which they are attached. Next, the spindle axis elongates, driving the centrioles (and the
set of chromosomes to which they are attached) apart to opposite ends of the cell. These
two stages are sometimes called 'early' and 'late' anaphase.
At the end of anaphase, the cell has succeeded in separating identical copies of the genetic
material into two distinct populations.
19.5 Telophase
Figure 17
The nonkinetochore microtubules elongate the cell and try to cut the cell in two. The nuclear
envelopes start to become created by fragments of the parents cell’s nuclear envelope. Then,
72
Cytokinesis
the chromatids start to become less tightly coiled together. By this point, cytokinesis is
fully under way.
19.6 Cytokinesis
Cytokinesis refers to the physical division of one eukaryotic cell. Cytokinesis generally
follows the replication of the cell's chromosomes, usually mitotically, but sometimes meiotically. Except for some special cases, the amount of cytoplasm in each daughter cell is the
same. In animal cells, the cell membrane forms a cleavage furrow and pinches apart like a
balloon. In plant cells, a cell plate forms, which becomes the new cell wall separating the
daughters. Various patterns occur in other groups.
In plant cells, cytokinesis is followed through by the usage of contracting ring of microfilaments that pull the cleavage furrow within itself, cutting the cell in two. In plant cells,
vesicles from the Golgi apparatus start to form a cell plate within the center of the cell.
When this cell plate solidifies and connects the two ends of the cell, a new cell wall is created
and two daughter cells are produced.
Figure 18 alt=The difference between Cytokinesis for animal and plant cells.
19.7 Regulation of Cell Cycle
Protein kinases are enzymes that activate or inactivate other proteins by phosphorylating
them. These give out the signals for the G1 and G2 checkpoints to occur. However, to
be active, the kinase must be attached to a cyclin. This is why it is called a CDK or a
cyclin-dependent kinase.
Internal kinetochores exhibit a wait function. Not until all kinetochores are attached to
a spindle microtubule does the cell process starts. This helps prevent some chromosomes
from being left behind. Density dependent inhibition is when cells have a cue to multiply
until a certain level of density is fulfilled. This means that a cell keeps multiplying until
there is a full layer or until a certain level of pressure is built upon each other.
One possible explanation of why cancer cells do not follow normal signals is because they
have an abnormality in the signaling pathway that conveys the growth factor’s signal to the
cell-cycle control system. Usually, a cell will follow normal checkpoints due to the release of
CDK in the system that regulate the cell process. However, in a cancer cell, the checkpoints
73
Mitosis
are random. This means that because the cell does not follow density-dependent inhibition
or follow the growth signals, the cell replicates at random points.

20 Genes
75

21 Expression
Gene expression is the first stage of a process that decodes what the DNA holds in a cell.
It is the expression of a gene that gives rise to a protein.
How does gene expression occur?
Genetic expression is a wide complex process. It must be regulated by a series of mechanisms.
It starts of with transcription that gives rise to the RNA messenger (RNAm) from DNA. The
RNAm in prokariotes is coupled with several ribosomes which are responsibles of translating
proteins.
In eukariotes RNAm that is made from DNA is immature, and it is called preRNAm.
PreRNAm loses non-coding sections (called exons), becoming onto a RNAm mature. RNAm
is coupled to ribosomes on Rough Endoplasmatic Reticle (RER) where translation happens.
Translation is made when a new polypeptide is formed. The genetic code indeed says the
order of pe polypeptides, but it doen't give us a clue about it tridimensional structure.
Tridimensional structure is given by post-translational processes.
Translation occurs following transcription wherein the protein synthesis machinery gets into
action and uses its tools to read out the message that the RNA holds.
There are some genes known to be without coding proteins. Yet, they work as regulation
sequences in a cell. In this case, the sequences can enhance coding (called "enhancers") or
they can inhibit (called "represors". When a protein is coupled with these genes, a substrate
or hormone, they join together.
In pluricellular organisms only few cell are allowed to produce a certain type of protein;
e.g.: Haemoglobin is encoded in every cell of a mammal organism (it includes human), but
only precursors of red blood cell are allowd to express it (red blood cell are not allowed to
express it, because they lose it nucleus). However, the enhancers and represors are present
in every cell of a mammal
Genetic Information
In nature, there is information found in all living cells. Different cultures have often studied
this information and used various forms of recording techniques to display it. Ancient Egyptians, in particular, referred to this information and its records as "provider of attributes"
and determined it ||| to mean several, and that was earlier in human history of recording
something that was known about nature.
There were often other signs as well that accompanied Egyptian writings on the source of
this "information key of life". Among them were double, water and wick of twisted flax.
But the most central one, for modern science, of course, was the snake like determinative
that meant a worm or serpent in the limit of life. This limit, water, was "N" meaning that
77
Expression
something or someone is, the essence which would be referred to by the Greeks as "esse" or
"ens", and in today's English terms, the "essence".
In anthropology, the language of gene expression is rooted in the sources of knowledge that
Odhiambo Siangla of Kenya has called "rieko" and Jeremy Narby of Switzeland has termed
the "cosmic serpent". Both Siangla and Narby are not only experts in cultures but are
trained in communication and expression. And from both the key has been the "three
letter word".
In the alphabet of the three letter word found in cell biology are the organic bases, which
are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T). It is the triplet recipe of these
bases that make up the ‘dictionary’ we call in molecular biology genetic code.
The codal system enables the transmission of genetic information to be codified, which at
molecular level, is conveyed through genes.
What is gene ? A gene is a region of DNA that produces a functional RNA molecule. If
a region of DNA is not functional, that region is not a transmissible form of information
for protein synthesis. And because the information is not transmissible, it is not readily
functional. There are various sizes of gene. The first recorded attempts to imagine the
very small was the Horus Eye, which is also a pristine idea of limit. Today we talk about
bases. The insulin gene, for example, has 1.7 x 103
, about 1700 nucleotides. There exists a receptor gene known as low-density lipoprotein (LDL). This protein has 4.5 x104
nucleotides. In terms of nucleotides this (LDL) approximates to 45,000 nucleotides. Now,
with the dystrophic gene as another example, we find the nucleotides to be around 2.0 x108
,
approximately 200,000,000 nucleotides in number.
Now, the introns. It is the noncoding regions of DNA that are called introns meaning the
“intervening sequences”. Introns make up a greater part of the nucleotide sequences of a
gene. The coding regions are called exons to mean “expression sequences”. They constitute
a minority of the nucleotide progression of a DNA and they instruct cellular workshops for
the formation of proteins via amino acids.
Through proteins, the expression of genetic information is achieved. In particular are the
enzymes. Even during the ancient time the enzymes were understood and utilized well.
The enzymes catalyze the chemical reactions of anabolic kind, that is, the building of
cellular food and those of catabolic type, the braking down of food. The two processes are
collectively termed metabolism. What, further, can we add about proteins?
We can further say that proteins are concentration of heteropolymers manufactured from
amino acids. There are 20 amino acids used in synthesizing natural proteins. It is clear
that a protein may consist of many, in fact, several hundred amino acid sediments. It is
essentially unlimited in number to speak about how many different proteins we can make
from combinations of amino acids. Mathematics explains it well. There is therefore a
diverse set of proteins whose forms and functions can be achieved by means of a coding
system explained below.
Genetic information flows unidirectional, from DNA to protein and with messenger RNA
(mRNA) as intermediate. First, DNA encodes genetic information into RNA molecule. This
is called transcription (TC) of the information. Then the information gets converted into
proteins, being named here translation (TL). It is this concept of information current that
78
Regulation of Cell Cycle
is called the Central Dogma of molecular biology. The Central Dogma is the fundamental
theme in our exploration on gene articulation.
In order to complete the picture, we can add two further aspects of information flow. We
can add duplication of the genetic material, which occurs prior to cell division. And that a
DNA, in this case, represents duplication process, —DNA transfer. Wherefore in this case
it is known as DNA replication. But where some viruses have RNA instead of DNA as their
genetic material, we speak about reverse transcription (RT). With this transcription, we
get a DNA molecule as a copy of the viral RNA genome.
In other words, genetic information, whether historically traced world wide (Narby,1998)
or particularly assigned to ancient Africa (Siangla,1997) involves gene expression. Both
DNA and RNA are polynucleotides, where nucleotides are the monomer—building units,
which are composed of three basic subunits called nitrogenous base, sugar, and phosphoric
acid. Genetic information is contained in DNA. The genetic code in DNA expresses the
connection between the polynucleotide alphabet of four bases and 20 amino acids. In one
strand of the parental DNA molecule, there is a dictated amino acid sequence strictly for
protein production.
We will discuss in the next few postings, a relatively detailed understanding of the polymerization of amino acids sequence as directed by base sequences of messenger RNA.
At the moment, though, let us note that protein synthesis is an expression of genetic information. Protein synthesis is the cellular procedure, as we have said, of making proteins
and involves two main processes: Transcription and Translation. The two processes mean
that the direction of the synthesis is from DNA to RNA and then from RNA to protein
respectively. Is this true to all organisms?
Yes. With a few exceptions, which are in mitochondria, and as stated above, some viruses
become exceptions to this order because in their genetic material, they have RNA instead of
DNA as their initial information source. However it is true that in all organisms, methods
that relate the nucleotide sequence in messenger RNA to the amino acid sequence in proteins (genetic code proper) are the same. For in the given exceptions there occurs reverse
transcription (RT). With that viral example of transcription noted, we get DNA molecular
information being copied from the genome of viral RNA.
Building on this clue that is provided by transcription processes, we can readily see that a
three-nucleotide sense codon denotes each amino acid. For example, UUU specifies phenylalanine, UCU specifies serine and GCA specifies alanine. But UAC and UAU both specify
tyrosine. We will speak more about this tyrosine when expanding cell biology in the study
of melanin.
Here now are other ways to see the remaining three properties of the genetic code. One is
the contiguous property. With this property the codons do not overlap and at the same time
they do not separated by spacers. The other is degenerate property in which there is more
than one codon for some amino acids as exemplified by tyrosine in the above paragraph.
And finally, there is the unambiguous property. With this genetic code of unambiguity,
each codon specifies only one amino acid.

22 Translation
The Translation Phase of Genetic Expression is divided into 2 Steps Transcription and
Translation. During Transcription RNA Polymerase unzips the two halfs of the DNA where
it needs to transcript. Then free RNA bases Attach to the DNA bases with the Polymerase
starting at the promoter and ending at the Termination signal. From this the RNA can
become mRNA, rRNA, or tRNA. The mRNA is a ribbon like strand that takes the genetic
information from the nucleus of the cell to the ribosome. rRNA forms a globular ball that
attaches to the rough E.R. to help make ribosomes. finally the tRNA forms a hair shaped
landing base that reads the genetic information to make proteins. Translation happens
when mRNA is pulled through a ribosome and tRNA reads the RNA bases on the mRNA
to make anti-codons of 3 bases and brings amino-acids to form the protein. This starts with
the condon AUG and ends at UAG. When done the protein forms the correct shape and
does the task it was created for. This brings the genetic code from the nucleus, which it
never leaves, to the cytoplasm of the cell where proteins are produced to upkeep the body.

changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of
such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which
is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If
such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL,
as needed to protect the freedom of users.
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions.
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.
“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients”
may be individuals or organizations.
To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the
earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.
A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work
based on the Program.
To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement
under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution
(with or without modification), making available to the public, and in
some countries other activities as well.
To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the
user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that
warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under
this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a
prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form
of a work.
A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.
The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if
any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce
the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for the
work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked
subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work. 2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in
force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From AntiCircumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect
to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the
work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention
of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms
added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of
this License along with the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5.
Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications
to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
* a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
it, and giving a relevant date. * b) The work must carry prominent
notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions
added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in
section 4 to “keep intact all notices”. * c) You must license the entire
work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any
applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and
all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives
no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. * d) If
the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate
Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that
do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make
them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used
to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond
what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an
aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of
the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:
* a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used
for software interchange. * b) Convey the object code in, or embodied
in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid
for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product
that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or
(2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at
no charge. * c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a
copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only
if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. * d) Convey the object code by offering access from a
designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to
the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at
no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the
object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a
different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to
the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy
these requirements. * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer
transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code
and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general
public at no charge under subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.
A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer
product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a
particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers
to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the
status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular
user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A
product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has
substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such
uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product
from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information
must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified
object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed
term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by
the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been
installed in ROM).
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include
a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient,
or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.
Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates
the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be
treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that
they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply
only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under
those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this
License without regard to the additional permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
* a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or * b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in
that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works
containing it; or * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of
that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be
marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or *
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or * e) Declining to grant rights under trademark
law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or *
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability
that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors
and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further
restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you
may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive
such relicensing or conveying.
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional
terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
applicable terms.
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
requirements apply either way. 8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having
Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to
receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing
other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify
any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept
this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work,
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic
Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work
the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of
the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or
can get it with reasonable efforts.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any
patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or
importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.
A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do
not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this
definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a
manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,
use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a
patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant
not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license
to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to
enforce a patent against the party.
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent
license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent
with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to
downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual
knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered
work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the
covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a
specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is
automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works
based on it.
A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted
under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are
a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business
of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third
party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and
under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would
receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a)
in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or
copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection
with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work,
unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was
granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise
be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of
Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to
terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from
those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy
91
Licenses
both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from
conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public
License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under
version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but
the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General
Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
choose that version for the Program.
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15.
Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
“AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,
OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program
in return for a fee.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms
to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright”
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
your option) any later version.
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty
of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice
like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program
comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show
w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under
certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an “about box”.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the
GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
24.2 GNU Free Documentation License
Version 1.3, 3 November 2008
Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation,
Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed. 0. PREAMBLE
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or
without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to
get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works
of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
designed for free software.
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to
any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and
is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or
distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part
a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that
says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does
not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be
designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant
Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections
then there are none.
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels)
generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing
editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters.
A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup,
or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format
is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy
that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standardconforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human
modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG,
XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can
be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
beginning of the body of the text.
The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ
stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document
means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no
effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the
back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as
the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited
to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque
copy a computer-network location from which the general networkusing public has access to download using public-standard network
protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added
material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute
an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
* A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original
publisher of that version gives permission. * B. List on the Title Page,
as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship
of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five
of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors,
if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. * C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher. * D. Preserve all the copyright
notices of the Document. * E. Add an appropriate copyright notice
for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. * F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of
this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. * G. Preserve
in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required
Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. * H. Include an
unaltered copy of this License. * I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title,
year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the
Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the
Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. * J. Preserve the
network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a
Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations
given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These
may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
location for a work that was published at least four years before the
Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
gives permission. * K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements"
or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in
the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. * L. Preserve all
the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and
in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered
part of the section titles. * M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
* N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. * O. Preserve any
Warranty Disclaimers.
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied
from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of
these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles
must be distinct from any other section titles.
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage
of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by
(or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document
already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by
you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one,
on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
one.
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING
DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under
this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list
them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant
Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies
of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is
included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this
License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
respects.
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy
of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License
in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7.
AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting
from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the
Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to
the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative
works of the Document.
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the
entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic
equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise
they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
8. TRANSLATION
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the
license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License
and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
disagreement between the translation and the original version of this
License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9.
TERMINATION
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS
LICENSE
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such
new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published
(not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License
can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version
permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
11. RELICENSING
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public
wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A "Massive
Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site means
any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike
3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-forprofit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published
by that same organization.
"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.
An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this License,
and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere
other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in
part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in
the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August
1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. ADDENDUM:
How to use this License for your documents
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy
of the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections,
no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license
is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with … Texts." line with this:
with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
LIST.
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.

GNU Lesser General Public License
24.3 GNU Lesser General Public License
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below. 0.
Additional Definitions.
As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the
GNU General Public License.
“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other
than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of
using an interface provided by the Library.
A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked
Version”.
The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source
code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation,
are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means
the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any
data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work
from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work. 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 2. Conveying
Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that
uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
* a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function
or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
purpose remains meaningful, or * b) under the GNU GPL, with none
of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts
and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or
fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. * b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU
GPL and this license document.
4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions
of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
covered by this License. * b) Accompany the Combined Work with a
copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. * c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include
the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a
reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this
license document. * d) Do one of the following: o 0) Convey the
Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and
the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under
terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application
with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU
GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. o 1) Use a suitable shared
library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism
is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present
on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a
modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the
Linked Version. * e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you
would otherwise be required to provide such information under section
6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined
Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a
modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the
Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding
Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1,
you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified
by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that
are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey
such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of
the following:
* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
conveyed under the terms of this License. * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the
Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
form of the same work.
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
published version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version
number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose
any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.
